# Table Structure Test Fix Summary

## Problem
The "Table Structure" test in the Testing Dashboard was failing because it was checking for tables with incorrect names that don't exist in the database.

## Root Cause
The test was checking for legacy table names:
- `automation_tasks` - but the actual table is `automation_jobs`
- `scraping_sessions` - but the actual tables are `scraping_schedules` and `scraping_history`

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/backend/app/routes/testing.py`
- **Line 166-167**: Changed table check from `automation_tasks` to `automation_jobs`
- **Line 167**: Changed table check from `scraping_sessions` to `scraping_schedules`

### 2. `/backend/app/monitoring/metrics_collector.py`
- **Line 109**: Updated table list to use `automation_jobs` instead of `automation_tasks`

## Verification
All required tables now exist in the database:
- ✅ `users` - 5 rows
- ✅ `work_orders` - 45 rows  
- ✅ `dispensers` - 359 rows
- ✅ `automation_jobs` - 0 rows (table exists, just empty)
- ✅ `scraping_schedules` - 2 rows

## Additional Notes
- The database actually contains 35 tables total
- The table names match the SQLAlchemy model definitions in `core_models.py`
- The metrics service uses "automation_tasks" as a metric name, which is fine (not a table reference)
- Created test script at `/backend/scripts/test_table_fix.py` for verification

## Result
The "Table Structure" test should now pass with all tables showing as existing.
