## Best Practices

When adding new scripts:
1. Place them in the appropriate directory based on their functionality
2. Use descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose
3. Add appropriate documentation at the top of the file
4. Update this README if adding a new category or changing functionality

## Running Scripts

Most scripts can be run with Node.js:

```bash
node scripts/category/script-name.js
```

For scripts referenced in package.json, use the npm command:

```bash
npm run script-name
```
