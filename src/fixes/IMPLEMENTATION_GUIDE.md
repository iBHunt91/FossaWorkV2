# FormPrep.tsx TypeScript Error Fixes

This document provides specific fixes for the TypeScript errors in your FormPrep.tsx file.

## Step 1: Fix UnifiedAutomationStatus Interface

Find where your `UnifiedAutomationStatus` interface is defined and add the missing properties from `UnifiedAutomationStatus.ts`.

## Step 2: Add ElectronAPI Type Definitions

To fix the ElectronAPI-related errors:

1. Locate your project's type declaration file for Electron (typically in a `.d.ts` file)
2. Add the missing methods from `electron.d.ts`

If you don't have an electron.d.ts file, create one in your project's types directory.

## Step 3: Fix Function Call Arguments

### Line 298: Expected 0 arguments, but got 2

Find this line:
```typescript
const status = await getUnifiedAutomationStatus(jobId, isBatch);
```

Change to:
```typescript
const status = await getUnifiedAutomationStatus(jobId);
```

### Line 1168: Expected 0 arguments, but got 1

Find the function call on line 1168 and remove the argument being passed.

## Step 4: Fix Batch Job Polling

1. Modify your component's cleanup function to use `stopAll()` instead of `pauseAll()`
2. Add the job existence check function from `PollingFixes.ts`
3. Update your polling logic to check if a job exists before polling

## Additional Recommendations

1. Use sessionStorage to preserve state across component remounts
2. Add proper cleanup for all intervals and timeouts
3. Implement a job registry system to track and clean up stale jobs

The complete solution with all these fixes is available in the provided files:
- UnifiedAutomationStatus.ts
- electron.d.ts
- FunctionCallFixes.ts
- PollingFixes.ts

## Testing Your Fixes

After implementing these changes:

1. Check that TypeScript errors are resolved
2. Verify that batch jobs work correctly
3. Test component unmounting and remounting to ensure polling behaves correctly
4. Check the console for any "polling anomaly" errors
