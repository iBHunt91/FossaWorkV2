# FormPrep Batch Job Fixes

This folder contains fixes for the batch job functionality and TypeScript errors in FormPrep.tsx.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Component Lifecycle Issues**
   - Fixed FormPrep component mounting/unmounting causing polling issues
   - Implemented proper cleanup of all polling resources on component unmount

2. **UI State Not Syncing with Backend**
   - Added proper state tracking and synchronization for batch jobs
   - Fixed "polling anomaly" errors by checking job existence before polling

3. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Fixed missing properties in the UnifiedAutomationStatus interface
   - Added proper type definitions for Electron API methods

4. **Multiple Concurrent Polling Instances**
   - Implemented a robust polling management system with proper cleanup
   - Added job registry to track and clean up stale jobs

## Implementation Instructions

### 1. Update UnifiedAutomationStatus Interface

In your code, find the `UnifiedAutomationStatus` interface and update it with the properties in `FormPrepFixes.tsx`, including:
- currentVisitName
- visitName
- currentVisitFuelType
- currentVisitFuelCurrent
- currentVisitFuelTotal

### 2. Fix Polling Mechanism

Replace your current polling management system with the improved version in `FormPrepFixes.tsx`. The new system:
- Properly cleans up all resources when component unmounts
- Checks job existence in state before polling
- Provides more reliable detection of job completion
- Prevents memory leaks from stale timers and intervals

### 3. Fix Component Unmounting

Update your component unmounting logic to use `stopAll()` instead of `pauseAll()`, as shown in `FormPrepFixes.tsx`.

### 4. Add Type Definitions for Electron API

Copy `electron.d.ts` to your project's type definitions folder to fix the TypeScript errors related to Electron API methods.

### 5. Fix Parameter Count Errors

When calling `getUnifiedAutomationStatus`, use the correct parameter count:
- Change `getUnifiedAutomationStatus(jobId, isBatch)` to `getUnifiedAutomationStatus(jobId)`

### 6. Add Job Registry

Implement the job registry system from `FormPrepFixes.tsx` to track and clean up stale jobs, which helps prevent "polling anomaly" errors.

## Testing

After implementing these changes:

1. Start a batch job and verify it processes correctly
2. Navigate away from the page and then back to ensure polling resumes properly
3. Check the browser console for any "polling anomaly" errors
4. Verify the UI updates correctly during job processing
