// Fix for line 298: Expected 0 arguments, but got 2
// Original code (problematic):
// const status = await getUnifiedAutomationStatus(jobId, isBatch);

// Replace with:
const status = await getUnifiedAutomationStatus(jobId);

// Fix for line 1168: Expected 0 arguments, but got 1
// You need to find this line and remove the argument being passed
// Without seeing the exact function definition, it's hard to provide the exact fix,
// but if it's similar to the other issue, you would change:
// someFunction(argument) to someFunction()
