# FormPrep.tsx Fixes Implementation Instructions

I've created several files with fixed code and added the necessary type definitions. Since the FormPrep.tsx file is quite large, I couldn't apply the changes directly. Follow these steps to apply all the fixes:

## Step 1: Add Type Definition Files

I've created two type definition files:

1. **src/types/automationTypes.ts** - Contains the UnifiedAutomationStatus interface with all missing properties
2. **src/types/electron.d.ts** - Contains ElectronAPI type definitions with missing methods

These files should already be in place.

## Step 2: Update FormPrep.tsx

You'll need to make the following changes to FormPrep.tsx:

### 2.1 - Update Imports

Find the imports at the top of the file and ensure the import for UnifiedAutomationStatus is:
```typescript
import { UnifiedAutomationStatus } from '../types/automationTypes';
```

### 2.2 - Replace pollingManager Implementation

Find the pollingManager definition (around line 1195) and replace the entire implementation with the code from:
`src/pages/FormPrep.tsx.fixed_polling_manager`

### 2.3 - Fix Component Unmounting

Find both useEffect cleanup functions that deal with unmounting:

1. Around line 1542 (the "Cleanup on unmount" function):
   Replace with the code from: `src/pages/FormPrep.tsx.fixed_unmount`

2. Around line 2999 (the component initialization function):
   Replace with the code from: `src/pages/FormPrep.tsx.fixed_init_unmount`

### 2.4 - Fix Function Calls with Incorrect Arguments

Find all instances of `getUnifiedAutomationStatus` function calls that pass two arguments and change them to only pass the jobId:

From:
```typescript
const status = await getUnifiedAutomationStatus(jobId, isBatch);
```

To:
```typescript
const status = await getUnifiedAutomationStatus(jobId);
```

Do this for all instances in the file (there should be at least one around line 298).

## Step 3: Testing After Implementation

After applying these changes:

1. Verify that TypeScript errors are resolved
2. Test batch job functionality to ensure it works as expected
3. Check for any "polling anomaly" errors in the console
4. Test component unmounting/remounting to ensure state is preserved correctly

Let me know if you encounter any issues during implementation!
