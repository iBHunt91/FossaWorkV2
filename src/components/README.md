# Form Automation - Implementation Changes

## Changes Made

I've completely refactored the FormPrep component by:

1. **Separating functionality into components:**
   - `SingleVisitAutomation.tsx` - Handles single visit form automation
   - `BatchVisitAutomation.tsx` - Handles batch visit form automation
   - `FormPrep.tsx` - Now a simpler container component that uses the above components

2. **Fixed polling issues:**
   - Implemented proper cleanup on component unmount
   - Ensured all timers and intervals are cleared appropriately
   - Added job existence checks before polling to prevent "polling anomaly" errors

3. **Added TypeScript definitions:**
   - Created `automationTypes.ts` with the `UnifiedAutomationStatus` interface
   - Created `electron.d.ts` with the missing ElectronAPI methods

4. **Improved error handling:**
   - Better error tracking and reporting
   - Proper state management for failed batch jobs

## How to Use

The form automation system is now split into two main components:

1. **Single Visit Automation:** Processes one visit at a time
   - Enter URL directly
   - Option to run headless or with browser visible (debug mode)
   - Shows job progress and status

2. **Batch Visit Automation:** Processes multiple visits
   - Select multiple visits from work orders
   - Option to run headless or with debug mode
   - Shows detailed progress including dispenser and fuel status
   - Option to resume from a failed batch

## Component Structure

```
FormPrep
├── SingleVisitAutomation
└── BatchVisitAutomation
```

Each component has its own state management and polling system, making the code more maintainable and reducing the chance of conflicts.

## Technical Improvements

1. More robust polling management:
   - Proper cleanup of all resources
   - Better handling of component mounting/unmounting
   - Prevention of duplicate polling instances

2. Better type safety:
   - Complete TypeScript definitions
   - Fixed all TypeScript errors

3. Improved UI feedback:
   - More detailed progress indicators
   - Better error messages
   - Consistent UI across components
