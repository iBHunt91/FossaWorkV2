## ❓ OPEN QUESTIONS

### High Priority Questions (Day 3)
1. Should we implement real Playwright browser automation or continue with mock data?
2. Which V1 features need to be migrated first?
3. Do we need JWT authentication now or use session-based?
4. Should we migrate V1 user data and settings?
5. What are the priority browser automation tasks?

### Technical Questions
1. How should we handle browser instances for multiple users?
2. Should automation run on server or client side?
3. What error recovery strategies for failed automation?
4. How to handle WorkFossa login credentials securely?
5. Rate limiting strategy for scraping?

## 📝 DECISIONS MADE

### Project Decisions
- Use FastAPI instead of Express.js for better performance
- SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- React Query for state management instead of Redux
- Archive V1 rather than incremental migration

### Technical Decisions
- Password hashing with BCrypt
- Multi-user data isolation by user_id
- Background tasks for scraping
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### **V1 Compatibility Decisions (January 8, 2025)**
- **MD5-based user ID generation** - Exact V1 compatibility for user switching
- **PostgreSQL with V1 data structure** - File system → Database migration
- **Comprehensive migration utilities** - Dry-run, validation, rollback capabilities
- **V1 API endpoint compatibility** - Seamless migration path
- **Activity tracking system** - Preserves V1 audit trail patterns

### Styling Decisions (Day 4 - January 8, 2025)
- **Pragmatic Polish Approach** over complex component redesign
