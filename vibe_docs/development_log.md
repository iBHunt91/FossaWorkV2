### [2025-06-09] - Comprehensive File Organization & Codebase Cleanup Complete
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: 
- Implemented comprehensive file organization enforcement in CLAUDE.md (Priority 1)
- Organized 50+ documentation files into proper /docs/ subdirectories
- Moved all backend test files from /backend/ to /tests/backend/
- Reorganized /tools/ directory with proper subdirectories:
  - Windows batch files ‚Üí /tools/windows/
  - Python debugging scripts ‚Üí /tools/debugging/
  - Backup scripts ‚Üí /tools/backup-removed-scripts/
- Moved setup scripts (get-pip.py) to /scripts/setup/
- Removed backup files (.backup, .bak) from codebase
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with comprehensive file placement rules for all file types
- Created immediate action checklist for session start enforcement

**Reason**: 
- Documentation was being created in root directory violating organization rules
- Test files and scripts were scattered throughout project directories
- Needed comprehensive enforcement to prevent future disorganization
- Required clear placement rules for all file types, not just documentation

**Impact**: 
- Clean, organized codebase with proper directory structure
- Automatic file organization enforcement at session start
- Clear rules for documentation, tests, scripts, tools, and configuration files
- Prevented future accumulation of loose files in wrong locations
- Improved maintainability and project navigation

**Next**: 
- Continue development with enforced organization standards
- All future files will be automatically organized per CLAUDE.md rules
- Session start protocol will scan and organize any misplaced files

### [2025-01-08] - V1 Comprehensive System Analysis Complete
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: 
- Conducted exhaustive analysis of V1 FossaWork system
- Documented all 29 critical business features and components
- Mapped complete data models, storage patterns, and API architecture
- Analyzed form automation engine with Playwright integration
- Documented business logic workflows and schedule change detection
- Identified filter calculation algorithms and notification systems
- Created comprehensive technical blueprint for V2 implementation
- Analyzed security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks

**Reason**: 
- Needed complete understanding of V1 system before V2 implementation
- Required detailed feature mapping for 100% parity
- Critical to understand complex business logic patterns
- Essential for proper data migration planning

**Impact**: 
- Complete roadmap for V2 feature implementation
- Clear understanding of all business logic requirements
- Identified critical security issues to avoid in V2
- Ready to implement browser automation with full context
- Data migration strategy fully planned

**Next**: 
- Implement V1-compatible form automation patterns
- Build WorkFossa integration with real data
- Start V1 data migration scripts
- Implement advanced browser automation features

### [2025-01-07] - Day 2 Complete & Project Reorganization
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: 
- Completed 100% Day 2 implementation (8/8 tests passing)
- Reorganized project structure - V1 archived, V2 promoted to main
- Full backend API with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
- Complete React frontend with TypeScript + Vite
- All CRUD operations for users and work orders
- Modern responsive UI with real-time features

**Reason**: 
- V2 implementation was complete and production-ready
- Nested directory structure was confusing
- Needed clean organization for continued development

**Impact**: 
- FossaWork directory now contains clean V2 codebase
- Legacy V1 safely preserved in V1-Archive-2025-01-07/
- Ready to proceed with browser automation and data migration

**Next**: 
- Day 3: Implement Playwright browser automation
- Connect real WorkFossa data instead of mock data
- Begin migrating V1 user data and settings

### [2025-01-06] - Foundation Complete
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: 
- Created complete V2 foundation with multi-user support
- Implemented secure authentication with BCrypt
- Built comprehensive data models for all entities
- Set up FastAPI backend with proper structure
- All foundation tests passing (6/6)

**Reason**: 
- Legacy V1 had critical security issues (plain text passwords)
- Needed modern architecture for scalability
- Multi-user support was essential requirement

**Impact**: 
- Solid foundation ready for feature implementation
- Security issues resolved from day one
- Scalable architecture for future growth

**Next**: 
- Implement core API endpoints
- Build React frontend
- Add WorkFossa scraping service

### [2025-01-06] - Initial Analysis & Planning
**Status**: PLANNING
**Changed**: 
- Analyzed legacy FossaWork V1 codebase
- Identified 150+ features requiring migration
- Created 5-day rebuild plan with Critical Path approach
- Decided on modern tech stack: FastAPI + React

**Reason**: 
- V1 had accumulated significant technical debt
- Security vulnerabilities needed immediate attention
- User requested analysis of "starting over" approach

**Impact**: 
- Clear roadmap for complete rebuild
- Modern tech stack chosen for better maintainability
- Security-first approach from ground up

**Next**: 
- Begin Day 1 foundation implementation
- Set up project structure
- Implement core data models

### [2025-01-16] - Dispenser Scraping UI Improvements
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Changed**: 
- Fixed NaN display issue in progress indicators by simplifying percentage calculations
- Removed all localhost modal confirmations (alert/confirm dialogs) for better UX
- Improved progress percentage calculations to better reflect actual work distribution (30-95% for scraping)
- Added comprehensive single work order dispenser scraping with progress tracking
- Fixed issue where UI showed completion before backend actually completed
- Fixed dispenser progress stuck on "connecting to workfossa" by adding proper polling
- Fixed duplicate progress cards showing for single dispenser scraping
- Ensured progress bar reaches 100% before showing success message

**Technical Details**:
- Added `singleDispenserProgress` state and polling mechanism in WorkOrders.tsx
- Created dedicated progress endpoint `/api/v1/work-orders/{work_order_id}/scrape-dispensers/progress`
- Implemented 500ms delay to show 100% progress before transitioning to success
- Separated batch vs single dispenser progress displays with proper conditions
- Added proper cleanup of polling intervals to prevent memory leaks

**Reason**: 
- User reported multiple UI issues affecting the dispenser scraping experience
- Progress indicators were confusing with NaN values and incorrect percentages
- Modal dialogs were interrupting workflow on localhost
- Success messages appeared before progress completed

**Impact**: 
- Smoother, more professional dispenser scraping experience
- Accurate progress tracking for both batch and single operations
- Non-blocking UI interactions
- Clear visual feedback throughout the scraping process

**Next**: 
- Monitor for any edge cases in progress tracking
- Consider adding estimated time remaining
- Potential WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
