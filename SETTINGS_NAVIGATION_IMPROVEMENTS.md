# Settings Navigation Improvements

## Overview
Improved the Settings page navigation and made it easier to find specific settings by implementing collapsible sections and direct navigation from the Work Order Sync component.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Collapsible Settings Sections**
- All settings are now in collapsible sections
- Sections are collapsed by default for cleaner navigation
- Click to expand only the section you need
- Visual chevron indicators show expand/collapse state

### 2. **Direct Navigation from Work Order Sync**
When clicking "Setup Sync" or "View Settings" from the Work Order Sync status:
- Navigates directly to Settings → Scraping tab
- Automatically expands the "Work Order Sync Schedule" section
- No need to hunt for the right setting

### 3. **URL Parameter Support**
The Settings page now supports URL parameters:
- `?tab=scraping` - Opens the Scraping tab
- `?section=scraping-schedule` - Expands the specific section
- Works for any tab and section combination

## Visual Changes

### Before:
```
Settings Page
├── Profile Tab
├── Notifications Tab
│   └── [All settings visible at once - overwhelming]
├── Scraping Tab
│   └── [Single component - no sections]
└── Advanced Tab
    └── [Multiple cards all expanded - very long page]
```

### After:
```
Settings Page
├── Profile Tab
├── Notifications Tab
│   └── [Settings in organized sections - collapsed by default]
├── Scraping Tab
│   └── ▶ Work Order Sync Schedule [Click to expand]
└── Advanced Tab
    ├── ▶ SMTP Email Server
    ├── ▶ Work Order Filters  
    ├── ▶ Automation Delays
    ├── ▶ Browser Settings
    └── ▶ Notification Display
```

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Faster Navigation**: Click from Work Order Sync directly to the right setting
2. **Cleaner Interface**: Only see the settings you're working with
3. **Better Organization**: Related settings grouped in clear sections
4. **Discoverable**: Section titles and descriptions help find features
5. **Direct Links**: Can bookmark or share specific settings sections

## Technical Implementation

### CollapsibleSection Component
A reusable component that provides:
- Consistent styling across all settings
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Icon support for visual context
- Title and description for clarity

### State Management
- `expandedSections` state tracks which sections are open
- URL parameters automatically expand relevant sections
- Sections remember their state during the session

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks "Setup Sync" in sidebar
2. URL changes to `/settings?tab=scraping&section=scraping-schedule`
3. Settings page reads URL parameters
4. Automatically switches to Scraping tab
5. Expands the Work Order Sync Schedule section
6. User sees exactly what they need to configure

## Future Enhancements

1. **Search Functionality**: Add search box to find settings quickly
2. **Favorites**: Pin frequently used settings to the top
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate sections
4. **Remember State**: Persist expanded sections in user preferences
5. **Breadcrumbs**: Show current location in settings hierarchy
