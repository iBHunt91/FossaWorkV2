# Monitor Command

**What it does:** Watches system metrics in real-time to help identify performance issues or problems.

**When to use it:**
- When the system feels slow
- To track API response times
- During heavy batch processing
- To find memory leaks

**How to use it:**
- `/monitor performance` - Overall system performance
- `/monitor api` - API endpoint response times
- `/monitor scraping` - Scraping success rates

**Example scenario:** Users report the system is running slowly. Type `/monitor performance` and Claude will show you CPU usage, memory consumption, slow database queries, and identify what's causing the bottleneck.

**Metrics Available:**
- `performance` - CPU, memory, disk I/O
- `memory` - Memory usage and leaks
- `api` - Response times, error rates
- `errors` - Error frequency and types
- `scraping` - Success rates, failures

**What you'll see:**
- ðŸ“Š Real-time graphs and metrics
- ðŸš¨ Alerts for anomalies
- ðŸ“ˆ Trends over time
- ðŸ’¡ Optimization suggestions
