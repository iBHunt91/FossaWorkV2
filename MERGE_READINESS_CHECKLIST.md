## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### 1. Critical Security Issues (Not Blocking Merge)
These exist in main branch already and are not introduced by this PR:
- Plain text credential storage (pre-existing)
- Overly permissive CORS in production (pre-existing)
- Limited input validation (pre-existing)

### 2. New Files Added
- **Documentation**: 5 new documentation files
- **Middleware**: `rate_limit.py` for DDoS protection
- **Components**: `confirmation-dialog.tsx`, `ScrapingStatusContext.tsx`
- **Scripts**: Various test and migration scripts
- **Test files**: Multiple test files (need organization post-merge)

### 3. Modified Core Files
- `auth_middleware.py` - Added CORS headers
- `scraping_schedules.py` - Added delete endpoints, fixed job ID handling
- `Login.tsx` - Removed credential logging
- `api.ts` - Added request/response masking

## üü¢ Merge Recommendation: APPROVED

### Rationale:
1. **All changes improve security** - No regressions introduced
2. **Backward compatible** - Safe to merge without breaking existing functionality
3. **Well documented** - Comprehensive documentation of all changes
4. **Tested manually** - All features verified working
5. **Clean git history** - Proper commit messages with conventional format

### Post-Merge Actions Required:
1. **Organize test files** - Move 30+ test files from backend root to proper directories
2. **Update main branch protection** - Ensure rate limiting doesn't affect CI/CD
3. **Monitor for issues** - Watch for any edge cases with new CORS headers
4. **Plan credential encryption** - Critical security issue to address in next sprint
