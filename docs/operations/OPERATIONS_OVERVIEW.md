# FossaWork V2 Operations Overview

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive operational framework for the security-enhanced FossaWork V2 application. It covers monitoring, incident response, maintenance procedures, and emergency protocols to ensure system reliability, security, and performance.

## System Architecture Summary

**Core Components:**
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript application with Electron desktop wrapper
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI with SQLite/PostgreSQL database
- **Security:** JWT authentication, encrypted credentials, rate limiting
- **Automation:** Playwright-based web scraping and form automation
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging system with structured JSON logs

## Key Metrics and SLAs

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Availability** | 99.5% | System uptime excluding planned maintenance |
| **Response Time** | < 2s | API endpoint response time (95th percentile) |
| **Authentication** | < 500ms | Login/token validation time |
| **Form Automation** | 95% success | Successful form submissions |
| **Data Sync** | < 5 min | WorkFossa data synchronization delay |
| **Recovery Time** | < 15 min | Maximum recovery time from incidents |

### Critical Alerts

**P1 - Critical (Immediate Response Required)**
- System down/inaccessible
- Authentication system failure
- Data corruption/loss
- Security breach detected
- Database connection failure

**P2 - High (Response within 30 minutes)**
- Performance degradation (>5s response times)
- Form automation failures >10%
- Elevated error rates (>5%)
- Certificate expiration warnings

**P3 - Medium (Response within 2 hours)**
- Individual feature failures
- Non-critical performance issues
- Log disk space warnings
- Backup validation failures

## Operational Framework

### Daily Operations
- Health check execution (automated)
- Log review and analysis
- Performance metrics review
- Security event monitoring
- Backup validation

### Weekly Maintenance
- System updates and patches
- Performance optimization review
- Security configuration audit
- Database maintenance
- Log rotation and cleanup

### Monthly Reviews
- Security posture assessment

- Capacity planning review
- Incident post-mortems
- Documentation updates

### Quarterly Audits
- Comprehensive security audit
- Compliance review
- Disaster recovery testing
- Architecture review
- Cost optimization analysis

## Monitoring Systems Integration

### Log Aggregation
- **Location:** `/logs/` directory with date-based rotation
- **Format:** JSONL (JSON Lines) for structured analysis
- **Retention:** 30 days local, 90 days archived
- **Categories:** frontend, backend, automation, errors, performance

### Metrics Collection
- **Application Metrics:** Response times, error rates, user activity
- **System Metrics:** CPU, memory, disk usage, network
- **Business Metrics:** Work orders processed, automation success rates
- **Security Metrics:** Authentication attempts, rate limit hits, anomalies

### Alerting Channels
- **Email:** Critical alerts to operations team
- **Pushover:** Real-time mobile notifications
- **Desktop:** Local system notifications
- **Logs:** All events captured in structured format

## Emergency Contact Information

### Primary Contacts

**System Administrator**
- Role: Primary technical contact
- Availability: 24/7 for P1 incidents
- Contact: [REDACTED - Configure in production]

**Security Officer**
- Role: Security incident response lead
- Availability: 24/7 for security events
- Contact: [REDACTED - Configure in production]

**Business Owner**
- Role: Business impact decisions
- Availability: Business hours + P1 escalation
- Contact: [REDACTED - Configure in production]

### Escalation Matrix

| Issue Type | L1 Response | L2 Escalation | L3 Escalation |
|------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| System Down | Ops Team | System Admin | Business Owner |
| Security Breach | Security Officer | External Security | Legal/Compliance |
| Data Loss | System Admin | Database Expert | Disaster Recovery |
| Performance | Ops Team | Performance Engineer | Architecture Team |

## Quick Reference Commands

### Health Checks
```bash
# System health check
python /tools/operations/health-check.py

# Application status
curl -f http://localhost:8000/api/health || echo "Backend DOWN"
curl -f http://localhost:5173/ || echo "Frontend DOWN"

# Database connectivity
python -c "from backend.app.database import get_db; next(get_db())"
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Recent errors
python /tools/operations/log-analyzer.py --errors --last-hour

# Performance issues
python /tools/operations/performance-monitor.py --alerts

# Security events
python /tools/operations/security-monitor.py --scan --last-24h
```

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Stop all services
pkill -f "uvicorn"
pkill -f "npm"
pkill -f "electron"

# Restart services
cd /backend && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
cd /frontend && npm run dev

# Backup current state
python /tools/operations/emergency-backup.py
```
