# Credential Verification Feature

## Overview
The credential verification feature allows users to update their Fossa login credentials with proper validation before saving. This ensures that only valid credentials are stored in the system.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (UserManagement.tsx)
- Added "Edit Credentials" button with key icon
- Inline editing form with email and password fields
- Client-side validation for email format
- Loading state during verification
- Proper error handling with specific messages
- Auto-reload for active user credential updates

### Backend API
- `PUT /api/users/:userId/credentials` - Updates user credentials
- `POST /api/users/verify-credentials` - Verifies credentials without saving

### Verification Process
1. User clicks "Edit Credentials" button
2. User enters new email and password
3. Basic validation performed (email format, required fields)
4. On submit, credentials are verified against Fossa login
5. If valid, credentials are updated in the database
6. If invalid, error message is shown without saving

### Security Features
- Credentials are verified before saving
- Invalid credentials are properly rejected
- Passwords are never shown in the UI
- Error messages don't reveal system information
- Environment variables properly managed
- Temporary browser sessions are properly closed

### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback during verification
- Specific error messages for different failure cases
- Loading spinner during verification process
- Auto-reload warning for active user updates
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions

### Error Handling
- Network errors: "Network error. Please check your connection"
- Timeout errors: "Request timed out. Please try again"
- Invalid credentials: "Invalid Fossa credentials"
- General errors: Shows the actual error message

### Testing
Three test scripts are provided:
1. `test-credential-update.js` - API integration test
2. `test-credential-verification.`
3. `test-frontend-credential-flow.js` - Frontend flow documentation

## Usage
1. Navigate to Settings > User Management
2. Find the user whose credentials need updating
3. Click "Edit Credentials" button (amber key icon)
4. Enter new email and password
5. Click "Verify & Save"
6. Wait for verification to complete
7. If successful, credentials are updated

## Technical Notes
- Uses Playwright for browser automation
- Verifies credentials by attempting actual login
- Maintains separation between verification and storage
- Handles active user credential updates with page reload
- Properly restores environment variables on error

## Future Enhancements
- Add password strength requirements
- Implement two-factor authentication support
- Add credential change history logging
- Support bulk credential updates
- Add email notification on credential changes
