# Form Prep Improvements

## Overview
The Form Prep page has been enhanced with several key improvements, particularly focusing on fixing the automatic URL population when selecting a work order.

## Visit URL Auto-Population Fix

### Issue Description
Previously, when users selected a work order from the list on the Form Prep page, the visit URL was not being automatically populated in the "Process Work Order Visit" section. This required users to manually enter or copy/paste the URL, creating an inefficient workflow.

### Implementation
The issue was resolved by adding a missing `useEffect` hook that properly updates the `visitUrl` state when a work order is selected:

```jsx
// Listen for selected work order changes and update the visit URL
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedWorkOrder && selectedWorkOrder.visits && selectedWorkOrder.visits.nextVisit) {
    // Get the URL from the selected work order
    const url = selectedWorkOrder.visits.nextVisit.url;
    
    // Ensure it's a complete URL with protocol
    if (url) {
      if (url.startsWith('http://') || url.startsWith('https://')) {
        setVisitUrl(url);
      } else {
        setVisitUrl(`https://${url}`);
      }
    }
  }
}, [selectedWorkOrder]);
```

### Benefits
- **Improved Efficiency**: Users no longer need to manually enter the visit URL
- **Reduced Errors**: Eliminates potential typos or URL formatting issues
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Creates a seamless process from work order selection to form processing
- **Better User Experience**: More intuitive interface behavior matching user expectations

## Additional Form Prep Enhancements

### JSX Structure Improvements
