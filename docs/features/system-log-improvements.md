# System Log Improvements

## Overview
The System Log component has been enhanced with several significant improvements to provide a better user experience and improved functionality.

## Chronological Log Display
Log entries are now displayed in chronological order, with newest entries appearing at the bottom. This follows the natural reading order of logs and matches the behavior of most terminal applications.

### Benefits
- More intuitive reading experience where the flow of events progresses from top to bottom
- Easier to follow log sequences and troubleshoot issues
- Better matches user expectation of how a log console should work
- Enables users to see the most recent log entries by scrolling to the bottom

### Implementation
The logs array is reversed before rendering, ensuring that older entries appear at the top and newer entries at the bottom.

## Server Console Integration
Server logs have been integrated into the "View Logs" feature, providing a centralized location to view all system logs.

### Benefits
- Consolidated logging interface for both client-side and server-side events
- Easier troubleshooting with access to all logs in one place
- Better context for diagnosing issues that span client and server components

### Implementation
- Added a new API endpoint to retrieve server logs
- Modified server logging functions to store logs in memory for retrieval
- Enhanced the frontend components to display server logs alongside other system logs
- Added automatic log refreshing to ensure the display stays current

## Visual Improvements
The System Log component has received visual enhancements to improve readability and usability.

### Benefits
- Improved readability with better contrast and spacing
- Clear visual distinction between different log levels (info, warning, error)
- More compact layout to maximize visible log entries
- Dark mode optimization for reduced eye strain

### Implementation
- Updated styling with Tailwind CSS
- Added color-coding for different log types
- Improved formatting of timestamps and log sources
- Enhanced hover states for better interactivity

## Usage
The improved System Log component can be accessed from the main navigation menu or through the "View Logs" button in various parts of the application.
