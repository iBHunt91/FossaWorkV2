# Work Week Logic Improvements

## Overview
The Work Week logic has been enhanced to improve reliability and user experience, particularly regarding the weekend mode transition and the "This Week"/"Next Week" view transitions.

## Key Improvements

### Weekend Mode Transition
- Fixed issues with weekend mode not activating correctly
- Implemented reliable detection of transition points
- Added persistence to prevent duplicate notifications
- Ensured weekend mode activates only once per day

### Week Transition Logic
- Improved the transition from "Next Week" to "This Week" after 5:00 PM
- Enhanced date range calculation for more accurate week boundaries
- Fixed issues with work orders not moving to the correct week view
- Implemented proper handling of multi-day work orders that span week boundaries

### Notification Improvements
- Eliminated duplicate toast notifications for transitions
- Added localStorage persistence for tracking notification status
- Implemented smarter detection to prevent notification loops
- Enhanced toast messages with clearer timing information

### State Management Enhancements
- Improved state handling to prevent refresh loops
- Added better synchronization between component states
- Implemented more robust localStorage usage for persistent settings
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases and unexpected states

## Technical Implementation

### Transition Detection
The system now uses a more reliable approach to detect transitions:
```javascript
// Only trigger the toast once per day
const todayStr = now.toDateString();
const lastNotificationDay = localStorage.getItem('weekendModeNotificationDay');

if (shouldActivateWeekendMode && lastNotificationDay !== todayStr) {
  // Show notification and update localStorage
  toast.showInfo(`Weekend mode activated. Tasks for ${formatDate(nextMonday)} are now visible.`);
  localStorage.setItem('weekendModeNotificationDay', todayStr);
}
```

### Date Range Calculation
Improved accuracy in determining the current and next week date ranges:
```javascript
// Get the date ranges for the current and next work weeks
function getWorkWeekDateRanges() {
  const now = new Date();
  const today = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate());
  
  // Consider after 5pm on Friday as weekend
  const isAfter5PM = now.getHours() >= 17;
  const isWeekend = today.getDay() === 0 || today.getDay() === 6 || 
                    (today.getDay() === 5 && isAfter5PM);
                    
  // Calculate boundaries
  // ...
}
```

## Benefits
- **More Reliable Transitions**: Week transitions now occur predictably at the correct times
- **Improved User Experience**: Reduced redundant notifications and clearer status indications
- **Better Data Organization**: Work orders consistently appear in the correct week view
- **Enhanced Weekend Mode**: Weekend mode now activates correctly, improving workflow for weekend scheduling
