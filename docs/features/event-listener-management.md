# Event Listener Management Improvements

## Overview
A solution has been implemented to prevent memory leaks caused by accumulating event listeners in the Electron IPC (Inter-Process Communication) system. This fix resolves the `MaxListenersExceededWarning` that was occurring during application usage.

## Problem Description
The application was experiencing the following issue:
```
MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 navigate listeners added to [EventEmitter]. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit
```

This warning indicated that too many event listeners were being attached to the IPC events without being properly cleaned up, potentially causing memory usage to grow over time and degrading application performance.

## Implemented Solution

### Listener Cleanup Approach
The solution focuses on cleaning up existing listeners before adding new ones, ensuring that the number of listeners doesn't continue to grow indefinitely.

```javascript
// In preload.js
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electron', {
  // Other exposed functions...
  
  // Navigation function with cleaned-up listeners
  navigate: (route) => {
    // Clean up existing listeners before adding new ones
    ipcRenderer.removeAllListeners('navigate');
    ipcRenderer.on('navigate', (_event, path) => {
      // Navigation logic...
    });
    
    ipcRenderer.send('navigate', route);
  },
  
  // Other IPC events with similar cleanup patterns
  openSettings: (section) => {
    ipcRenderer.removeAllListeners('open-settings');
    ipcRenderer.send('open-settings', section);
  }
});
```

### Comprehensive Event Cleanup
The fix was applied to all IPC events in the application:
- Navigation events
- Data refresh events
- Settings-related events
- Utility function events

### Best Practices Implemented
- Use of `removeAllListeners()` for each event type before adding new listeners
- Proper event naming conventions for consistency
- Clear separation of event handling logic
- Improved IPC bridge architecture

## Benefits

### Improved Memory Management
- Prevents accumulation of duplicate event listeners
- Reduces memory usage over extended application usage periods
- Eliminates `MaxListenersExceededWarning` messages

### Enhanced Application Stability
- Reduces the risk of application crashes from memory issues
- Improves long-term stability during extended usage sessions
- Prevents potential performance degradation from resource leaks

### Better Development Practices
- Implements proper event lifecycle management
- Follows recommended Electron IPC patterns
- Provides a pattern for future IPC implementations

## Detection and Verification
The solution was tested by:
1. Running the application with extended usage sessions
2. Monitoring memory usage before and after the fix
3. Checking application logs for the warning message
4. Verifying that all application functionality remains working correctly

No warnings or memory issues have been observed since implementing the fix.
