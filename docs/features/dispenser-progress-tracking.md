# Enhanced Dispenser Progress Tracking

This feature provides detailed real-time tracking of dispenser and fuel grade information during FormPrep automation.

## Overview

When running single visit automation, users now see:
- Individual dispensers being processed
- Fuel grades for each dispenser
- Real-time progress updates
- Visual status indicators

## Features

### 1. Dispenser Progress Cards

Each dispenser shows:
- Dispenser title and number
- Form number (e.g., "Form 1/3")
- Current status (pending, processing, completed, error)
- Current action being performed
- Progress bar for overall completion

### 2. Fuel Grade Tracking

For each fuel grade within a dispenser:
- Grade name (e.g., "87 Octane Regular")
- Processing status 
- Prover selection (when applicable)
- Meter selection (when applicable)
- Status messages

### 3. Visual Indicators

The UI uses color coding:
- Gray: Pending
- Blue: Processing (with animated spinner)
- Green: Completed
- Red: Error

   - Enhanced updateStatus function to include dispenserProgress
   - Tracks progress at each step of form filling
   - Updates fuel grade status as they're processed

2. **UnifiedAutomationStatus type**

   - Includes dispenser and fuel grade tracking

### API Response Structure

```typescript
{
  status: 'running',
  message: 'Processing form 1/3...',
  dispenserProgress: {
    workOrderId: 'W-12345',
    dispensers: [{
      dispenserTitle: 'Dispenser #1/2',
      dispenserNumber: '1',
      formNumber: 1,
      totalForms: 3,
      status: 'processing',
      currentAction: 'Filling fuel grade information',
      fuelGrades: [{
        grade: '87 Octane Regular',
        status: 'completed',
        prover: 'P1',
        meter: 'M1',
        message: 'Successfully saved'
      }, {
        grade: '89 Plus',
        status: 'processing',
        message: 'Filling form data'
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## User Experience

1. User starts single visit automation
2. Progress cards appear showing each dispenser
3. As automation progresses:
   - Dispensers change from pending to processing
   - Individual fuel grades show processing status
   - Completed items turn green with checkmarks
   - Current actions are displayed in real-time

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
npm run test:dispenser-progress
```

This test:
- Starts a single visit automation
- Polls for status updates
- Verifies dispenser progress data is present
- Displays the progress information

## Benefits

1. **Better Visibility**: Users can see exactly what's happening during automation
2. **Debugging**: Easier to identify where issues occur
3. **Progress Tracking**: Clear indication of completion status
4. **User Confidence**: Real-time feedback reduces uncertainty

## Future Enhancements

1. Add progress percentages for each dispenser
2. Include timing information (elapsed/estimated)
3. Add ability to pause/resume per dispenser
4. Export progress logs for troubleshooting
