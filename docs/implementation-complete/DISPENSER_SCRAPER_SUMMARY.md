# Dispenser Scraper Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Core Dispenser Information
- **Title**: Preserved exactly as displayed on website for dropdown compatibility
- **Serial Number**: Extracted from "S/N:" field
- **Make**: Extracted cleanly without "MAKE:" prefix (e.g., "Gilbarco")
- **Model**: Extracted cleanly without "MODEL:" prefix (e.g., "NL3")

### 2. Dispenser Numbers
- **dispenser_number**: Combined format (e.g., "1/2" for dual-sided, "1" for single-sided)
- **dispenser_numbers**: Array of individual sides (e.g., ["1", "2"] or ["1"])
- Handles both single and dual-sided dispensers

### 3. Additional Fields
- **Stand Alone Code**: Extracted from "STAND ALONE CODE" field
- **Number of Nozzles**: Extracted as numeric value (e.g., "3")
- **Meter Type**: Extracted from "METER TYPE" field (e.g., "Electronic")

### 4. Fuel Grades
- **grades_list**: Ordered list of fuel grades according to fuel_grades.py
- **fuel_grades**: Dictionary of fuel grade information
- Title preserved with original grade order for dropdown compatibility

### 5. Data Structure
```python
@dataclass
class DispenserInfo:
    dispenser_id: str
    title: str
    serial_number: Optional[str]
    make: Optional[str]
    model: Optional[str]
    dispenser_number: Optional[str]  # "1/2" or "1"
    dispenser_numbers: List[str]     # ["1", "2"] or ["1"]
    stand_alone_code: Optional[str]
    number_of_nozzles: Optional[str]
    meter_type: Optional[str]
    fuel_grades: Dict[str, Any]
    grades_list: List[str]           # Ordered by fuel_grades.py
    custom_fields: Dict[str, str]
```

## Example Output
```
âœ… Dispenser found:
      Title: 15/16 - Regular, Plus, Diesel, Ethanol-Free Gasoline Plus, Super - Gilbarco
      S/N: EN00037197
      Make: Gilbarco, Model: NL3
      Grades: Regular, Super, Plus, Ethanol-Free Gasoline Plus, Diesel
      Dispenser Number(s): 15/16
      Stand Alone Code: 0128
      Number of Nozzles: 3
      Meter Type: Electronic
```

## Important Notes

1. **Grade Ordering**: The grades_list is ordered according to fuel_grades.py (copied from fuel_grades.js). The current order is based on the master list, not alphabetical or by octane level.

2. **Title Preservation**: The title field maintains the exact format from the website, including the original grade order. This is critical for future dropdown automation.

3. **Extraction Robustness**: The scraper handles case variations (MAKE/Make, MODEL/Model) and extracts all available fields when present.

4. **Database Storage**: All fields are included in the dict conversion for database persistence.
