# Work Order Sync UX Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the Work Order Sync component in the sidebar with improved visual design, better information hierarchy, and more intuitive interactions.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Visual Design Enhancements
- **Larger, clearer icons** (16x16px) with better visual weight
- **Gradient background** with subtle glass morphism effect
- **Improved status indicators** with contextual colors and animations
- **"LIVE" badge** appears when sync is actively running
- **Subtle hover effects** with shadow and border transitions

### 2. Information Hierarchy
- **Component title** "Work Order Sync" is now prominent within the component
- **Smart time display**:
  - Shows exact minutes when less than an hour (e.g., "45 min")
  - Shows hours and minutes for longer durations (e.g., "1h 30m")
  - "Any moment..." for overdue syncs
  - "Syncing now..." with blue text when actively running
- **Status dot** indicator next to expand/collapse chevron shows last sync success/failure

### 3. Expanded View Improvements
- **Grid layout** for Next Sync and Last Sync times
- **Uppercase labels** with better spacing and typography
- **Stats card** with icon showing processed orders count
- **Action buttons**:
  - "View Orders" - Quick navigation to work orders page
  - "Settings" - Direct link to sync configuration
- **Better visual separation** with subtle borders and spacing

### 4. Empty State
- **Call-to-action design** with dashed border when no sync is configured
- **"Enable Auto-Sync"** clear messaging
- **Hover animation** with arrow indicating clickability

### 5. Status States
The component now clearly differentiates between:
- **Active/Running**: Blue glow, spinning icon, "LIVE" badge
- **Scheduled**: Green subtle glow, shows next run time
- **Failed**: Red subtle glow, error icon
- **Paused**: Muted appearance with pause icon

### 6. Interaction Improvements
- **Click to expand/collapse** for more details
- **Smooth animations** for all state transitions
- **Responsive hover states** with visual feedback
- **Quick actions** accessible without navigating away

## Technical Changes
- Updated `ScrapingStatus.tsx` component with improved styling
- Enhanced time formatting functions for better readability
- Added ChevronRight icon import for empty state
- Removed redundant label from Navigation.tsx
- Improved responsive design with better spacing

## Result
The Work Order Sync component now provides a more professional, intuitive interface that gives users quick access to sync status and controls while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic that fits with the overall application design.
