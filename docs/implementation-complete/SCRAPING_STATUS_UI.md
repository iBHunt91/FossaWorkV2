# Scraping Status UI Implementation

## Overview

We've added a real-time scraping status indicator that displays:
- When the next scrape will occur
- When the last scrape happened
- Current status (Active, Paused, Running, Failed)
- Number of items processed
- Visual indicators with contextual colors and animations

## Components Added

### 1. ScrapingStatus Component (`frontend/src/components/ScrapingStatus.tsx`)

A flexible status display component with two modes:

#### Compact Mode (Sidebar)
- Shows in the navigation sidebar on all pages
- Displays essential information:
  - Current status with icon
  - Expandable for more details
  - Click to expand/collapse
- Glow effects:
  - Blue pulse when actively scraping
  - Green when active and healthy
  - Red when last run failed
  - Gray when paused

#### Full Mode (Work Orders Page)
- Comprehensive display with all details
- Shows:
  - Next run time with countdown
  - Last run time with relative display
  - Exact time in parentheses
  - Items processed count
  - Success/failure indicators

### 2. Integration Points

#### Navigation Sidebar
- Added to `Navigation.tsx` after the theme toggle
- Visible on all pages
- Compact mode for space efficiency
- Animated entrance with slide-in effect

#### Work Orders Page
- Added between header and main content
- Full display mode with all details
- Synchronized with the page's glow card styling
- Provides context for manual scraping actions

## Visual Features

### Status Indicators
- **Running**: Blue spinning refresh icon with pulse animation
- **Active**: Green checkmark icon
- **Failed**: Red alert icon
- **Paused**: Gray pause icon

### Glow Effects
- Matches the GlowCard component styling
- Dynamic colors based on status
- Smooth transitions between states

### Time Display
- Relative time (e.g., "in 45 minutes", "23 minutes ago")
- Exact time shown for next run (e.g., "8:00 AM")
- Auto-updates every 30 seconds

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
- Polls `/api/scraping-schedules/` for schedule info
- Polls `/api/scraping-schedules/history/work_orders` for last run
- Updates every 30 seconds automatically
- Combines data for comprehensive status

### State Management
- Local component state for status data
- Loading states with skeleton loaders
- Error handling with fallback displays

### Responsive Design
- Works on all screen sizes
- Compact mode for mobile/sidebar
- Full details on larger screens

## Usage

The component automatically displays when:
1. A scraping schedule exists
2. User is authenticated
3. Backend is accessible

No configuration needed - it's plug and play!
