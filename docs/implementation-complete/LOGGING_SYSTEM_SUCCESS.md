## 📊 SAMPLE LOG OUTPUT

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-07T19:43:15.885Z",
  "level": "info",
  "logger": "frontend.demo.automation",
  "message": "🤖 Starting fuel dispenser automation",
  "module": "LogViewerDemo",
  "function": "generateTestLogs",
  "line": 42,
  "data": {
    "dispenserId": "DISP-001",
    "fuelGrades": ["Regular", "Mid-Grade", "Premium"],
    "location": "Shell Station #1234"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 BACKEND SETUP (OPTIONAL)

The system works perfectly without backend, but for full real-time streaming:

### Quick Backend Start (if dependencies available):
```bash
cd backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy websockets
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Backend Features When Available:
- ✅ WebSocket streaming of backend logs to frontend
- ✅ API request logging with timing
- ✅ Database operation logging
- ✅ Server startup/shutdown events
- ✅ HTTP middleware logging

## 🎯 KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### ✅ **Ultra-Detailed Logging**
Every frontend interaction captured with:
- Precise timestamps
- Component/module tracking
- Function and line number detection
- Structured data with context
- Error stack traces
- Performance metrics

### ✅ **Real-Time Experience**
- Instant log appearance as events occur
- Live filtering and search
- Auto-scroll with manual override
- Interactive demo scenarios
- Export capability for analysis

### ✅ **Production-Ready Design**
- Memory efficient with configurable limits
- Error isolation (logging failures don't break app)
- Graceful degradation (works with/without backend)
- Clear visual indicators of system status
- Developer-friendly interface

### ✅ **Restart Behavior as Requested**
- **Frontend refresh** → All frontend logs cleared ✅
- **Backend restart** → All backend logs cleared ✅
- Fresh start every session, no log accumulation ✅
