# Filter Inventory Tracking - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive filter inventory tracking system that integrates seamlessly with the filter calculation service to provide real-time inventory management, usage tracking, and intelligent reordering.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Models (`/backend/app/models/filter_inventory_models.py`)
- **Lines of Code**: 284
- **Models Created**:
  - `FilterInventory` - Current inventory levels and reorder points
  - `FilterInventoryTransaction` - Complete transaction history
  - `FilterAllocation` - Reserved filters for upcoming work
  - `FilterReorderHistory` - Purchase order tracking
  - `FilterUsagePattern` - Analytics and forecasting
  - `FilterInventoryAlert` - Low stock and reorder alerts

### 2. Inventory Service (`/backend/app/services/filter_inventory_service.py`)
- **Lines of Code**: 740
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic inventory initialization
  - Stock receipt and adjustment tracking
  - Usage recording from completed work orders
  - Filter allocation for upcoming jobs
  - Multi-day job handling (no double-counting)
  - Reorder point monitoring
  - Usage analytics and forecasting
  - Alert generation and management

### 3. API Routes (`/backend/app/routes/filter_inventory.py`)
- **Lines of Code**: 446
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/inventory/initialize` - Set up inventory records
  - `GET /api/inventory/status` - Current stock levels
  - `POST /api/inventory/add-stock` - Record filter receipts
  - `POST /api/inventory/record-usage` - Automatic usage tracking
  - `POST /api/inventory/allocate` - Reserve filters
  - `GET /api/inventory/analytics` - Usage patterns
  - `GET /api/inventory/reorder-suggestions` - Smart reordering
  - `GET /api/inventory/transactions/{part}` - Audit trail

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### Real-Time Inventory Tracking
- Current stock levels (on-hand, allocated, available)
- Box quantity calculations
- Stock level indicators (NORMAL, LOW_STOCK, CRITICAL, OUT_OF_STOCK)

#### Transaction Management
```python
Transaction Types:
- RECEIPT: Adding stock from suppliers
- USAGE: Automatic deduction from work orders
- ADJUSTMENT: Manual corrections
- ALLOCATION: Reserving for future work
- RETURN: Unused filter returns
```

#### Smart Reorder System
- Configurable reorder points by filter series
- Average daily usage calculations
- Days of supply forecasting
- Urgency-based prioritization
- Integration with notification system

#### Allocation System
- Reserve filters for scheduled work
- Prevent double-booking of inventory
- Auto-expire unused allocations
- Convert to usage on work completion

### 5. Integration Points

#### Filter Calculation Integration
When a work order is completed:
1. Filter calculation determines filters used
2. Inventory service records usage transaction
3. Stock levels automatically updated
4. Allocations converted to actual usage
5. Reorder alerts triggered if needed

#### Notification System Integration
- Low stock alerts via email/Pushover
- Reorder needed notifications
- Critical stock level warnings
- Allocation failure alerts

### 6. Analytics Capabilities

- **Usage Patterns**: Track consumption by part number, station, time period
- **Forecasting**: Calculate average daily usage and days of supply
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify increasing/decreasing usage patterns
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor filter costs and inventory value

## Business Value
