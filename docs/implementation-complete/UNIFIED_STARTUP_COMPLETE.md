# ✅ Unified Startup System Complete

## Overview

The FossaWork V2 system now has a single, unified startup script that handles everything automatically.

## Single Command: `start-fossawork.bat`

Located in `/tools/start-fossawork.bat`, this script:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Checks Python installation
   - Creates virtual environment if needed
   - Installs all backend dependencies
   - Installs Playwright browsers

2. **Process Management**
   - Kills any existing Python/Node processes
   - Ensures clean startup every time

3. **Server Launch**
   - Starts backend with `app.main:app` (full authentication)
   - Starts frontend development server
   - Waits for services to be ready

4. **User Experience**
   - Shows clear progress messages
   - Opens browser automatically
   - Displays all relevant URLs

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated start-fossawork.bat
- Changed from `app.main_simple:app` to `app.main:app`
- Added full environment setup and dependency checking
- Increased startup steps from 4 to 7 for better visibility
- Added authentication status URL in output

### 2. Fixed Missing Logging Route
- Added `/api/v1/logs/write` endpoint to handle frontend logging
- Frontend was getting 404 errors when trying to log
- Now properly accepts and processes frontend log entries

### 3. Removed Redundant Scripts
Deleted the following duplicate startup scripts:
- `start-backend-dev.bat`
- `start-backend-quick.bat`  
- `start-backend.bat`
- `Start-Backend.ps1`

Only keeping:
- `start-fossawork.bat` - Main unified startup
- `start-frontend.bat` - Standalone frontend (if needed)

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Updated main README.md with single startup command
- Created `/tools/STARTUP_GUIDE.md` with detailed usage
- Removed references to multiple startup scripts

## Authentication System Integration

The unified startup now launches the full authentication-enabled backend:

- **Zero Users on Start**: No default accounts
- **WorkFossa Authentication**: Real credential verification
- **JWT Token System**: Secure API access
- **Protected Routes**: All endpoints require authentication

## Usage

```cmd
cd tools
start-fossawork.bat
```

That's it! Everything else is handled automatically.

## Server URLs

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Authentication Status: http://localhost:8000/api/setup/status

## First-Time Setup

1. Run `start-fossawork.bat`
2. Check auth status at http://localhost:8000/api/setup/status
3. If no users exist, use `/api/setup/initialize` with WorkFossa credentials
4. Save the JWT token for API access

## Testing Tools

- `tools\reset-database.bat` - Reset to zero users
- `backend\test_zero_users.py` - Test authentication flow
- `backend\test_auth_flow.py` - Comprehensive auth tests

## Summary

The system now has:
- ✅ Single unified startup script
- ✅ Full authentication system
- ✅ Zero-user security model
- ✅ Automatic environment setup
- ✅ Fixed frontend logging errors
- ✅ Clean, organized tools directory

Everything is ready for use with the single `start-fossawork.bat` command!
