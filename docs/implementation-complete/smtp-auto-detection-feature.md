# SMTP Auto-Detection Feature

**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Feature:** Automatic SMTP server detection based on email address

## Overview

Users often don't know their SMTP server settings, making email configuration difficult. This feature automatically detects SMTP server settings based on the user's email domain, significantly simplifying the setup process.

## How It Works

1. User enters their email address in the auto-detect field
2. System extracts the domain from the email
3. Domain is matched against a database of known providers
4. If found, SMTP settings are automatically populated:
   - SMTP server address
   - Port number
   - Security settings (TLS/SSL)
   - Username (set to the email address)
   - Provider-specific notes and warnings

## Supported Providers

### Major Email Providers
- **Gmail** (gmail.com, googlemail.com)
  - Server: smtp.gmail.com
  - Port: 587 (TLS)
  - Note: Requires App Password

- **Outlook/Hotmail** (outlook.com, hotmail.com, live.com, msn.com)
  - Server: smtp-mail.outlook.com
  - Port: 587 (TLS)
  - Note: May require app password with 2FA

- **Yahoo** (yahoo.com, ymail.com)
  - Server: smtp.mail.yahoo.com
  - Port: 587 (TLS)
  - Note: Requires App Password

- **Apple iCloud** (icloud.com, me.com, mac.com)
  - Server: smtp.mail.me.com
  - Port: 587 (TLS)
  - Note: Requires app-specific password

### Business Email
- **Office 365** - For business accounts
- **Custom Domains** - Shows helpful guidance

## User Experience

### Before Auto-Detection
1. User had to know:
   - SMTP server address
   - Correct port number
   - Whether to use TLS or SSL
   - Authentication requirements

2. Common issues:
   - Wrong server address
   - Incorrect port/security combination
   - Not knowing about app passwords
   - Confusion about TLS vs SSL

### After Auto-Detection
1. User enters email address
2. Clicks "Auto-Detect" button
3. All technical settings populated automatically
4. Clear instructions about app passwords shown
5. Only password needs to be entered manually

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

**1. Auto-Detection UI (`Settings.tsx`)**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-4 p-4 bg-muted/30 rounded-lg border border-muted">
  <Sparkles className="w-5 h-5 text-primary" />
  <h4>Auto-Detect SMTP Settings</h4>
  <Input type="email" placeholder="your-email@example.com" />
  <Button onClick={autoDetect}>Auto-Detect</Button>
</div>
```

**2. Provider Database (`smtpProviders.ts`)**
- Comprehensive list of email providers
- SMTP configurations for each
- Provider-specific notes and requirements
- OAuth indicators for future enhancement

**3. Detection Logic**
- Email validation
- Domain extraction
- Provider lookup
- Settings application
- User feedback

### Key Features

1. **Smart Detection**
   - Instant recognition of 30+ email providers
   - Handles multiple domains per provider
   - Provides custom guidance for unknown domains

2. **Security Settings**
   - Automatically sets TLS/SSL based on provider
   - Mutually exclusive security options
   - Clear visual indication of security status

3. **User Guidance**
   - Provider-specific notes displayed
   - Links to app password creation pages
   - Clear indication when OAuth is preferred

4. **Convenience Features**
   - Auto-fills username with email
   - Pre-populates test email field
   - Shows detected provider name
   - Retains manual override capability

## Testing

Created test script at `/scripts/testing/test_smtp_auto_detect.py` that verifies:
- Provider detection for all supported domains
- Handling of unknown domains
- Invalid email handling
- Correct settings returned

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Support Burden**
   - Fewer questions about SMTP settings
   - Less confusion about ports and security
   - Clear guidance about app passwords

2. **Improved User Experience**
   - Faster setup process
   - Higher success rate
   - Less technical knowledge required

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Correct settings from the start
   - Security settings properly configured
   - Provider-specific requirements highlighted

## Future Enhancements

1. **OAuth Support**
   - Implement OAuth flow for providers that support it
   - Eliminate need for app passwords where possible

2. **Auto-Discovery**
   - DNS-based auto-discovery for custom domains
   - MX record analysis for better detection

3. **Provider Updates**
   - Regular updates to provider database
   - API for fetching latest configurations

4. **Enhanced Validation**
   - Test connection before saving
   - Verify app password requirements
   - Check for 2FA status

## User Guide

### For End Users

1. **To use auto-detection:**
   - Go to Settings → Technical → SMTP Email Server
   - Enter your email address in the auto-detect field
   - Click "Auto-Detect"
   - Review the populated settings
   - Enter your app password (not regular password!)
   - Click "Save SMTP Settings"

   - Follow the provider-specific instructions shown
   - You can still manually edit any auto-detected setting

3. **If your provider isn't recognized:**
   - Check with your email provider or IT department
   - Common settings are port 587 with TLS
   - Try searching "[provider name] SMTP settings"
