450 Series (Wawa):
- 450MB-10: $9.00/filter ($90/box)
- 450MG-10: $9.25/filter ($92.50/box)
- 450MD-10: $9.50/filter ($95/box)

800 Series (High Flow/DEF):
- 800HS-30: $6.50/filter ($195/box of 30)
- 800CHS-10: $18.00/filter ($180/box of 10)
```

### 5. Integration Points

#### Filter Calculation Integration
When work order is completed:
1. Filter calculation determines filters used
2. Cost service calculates total costs
3. Costs tracked by work order and station
4. High-cost alerts triggered if over $500

#### Inventory Integration
- Uses current inventory costs if available
- Falls back to default pricing
- Updates with purchase order receipts
- Tracks cost per box for accurate pricing

#### Notification Integration
- Budget warning alerts at 80% utilization
- Budget exceeded notifications
- High-cost work order alerts
- Price increase notifications

### 6. Advanced Analytics

#### Cost Trend Analysis
- Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly periods
- Filter-level cost breakdowns
- Trend direction detection
- Next period forecasting
- Station-specific filtering

#### Budget Reports
- Actual vs budget comparison
- Burn rate calculations
- Projected end-of-period spending
- Top cost drivers (filters & stations)
- Automated alert generation

#### Supplier Comparison
- Multi-supplier price tracking
- Average price calculations
- Best price identification
- Potential savings calculations
- Switching recommendations

cost_result = await cost_service.calculate_work_order_cost(
    work_order_id="WO-2024-001",
    filter_calculation_result=filter_result
)
# Returns: Total cost $125.50 with breakdown by filter type
```

### Generate Budget Report
```python
report = await cost_service.generate_budget_report(
    user_id="user123",
    budget_amount=Decimal("5000.00"),
    period_start=date(2024, 1, 1),
    period_end=date(2024, 3, 31)
)
# Returns: 96.5% utilization with projection alerts
```

### Compare Suppliers
```python
comparison = await cost_service.compare_supplier_prices(
    part_numbers=["400MB-10", "800HS-30"]
)
# Returns: BulkSupply offers $0.25/filter savings on 400MB-10
```
