# Browser Visibility Fix Implementation Complete

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the browser visibility feature for scheduled work order syncs.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Model Update
- Added `show_browser_during_sync` field to the `BrowserSettings` model in `/backend/app/routes/settings.py`
- This field is now properly saved to and loaded from the JSON settings file

### 2. Scheduler Daemon Update
- Modified `scheduler_daemon.py` to read browser settings from the JSON settings file instead of the database
- The scheduler now correctly reads the `show_browser_during_sync` setting and sets `headless` mode accordingly
- When `show_browser_during_sync` is True, the browser window will be visible during scheduled syncs

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Updated `ScrapingScheduleEnhanced.tsx` to save both `headless` and `show_browser_during_sync` settings
- The component now correctly reads the `show_browser_during_sync` setting when loading browser preferences
- The "Show browser during sync" toggle now properly persists its state

## Files Modified

1. **`/backend/app/routes/settings.py`**
   - Added `show_browser_during_sync: bool = Field(False, description="Show browser window during scheduled sync operations")` to BrowserSettings model

2. **`/backend/scheduler_daemon.py`**
   - Changed from reading UserPreference database table to reading JSON settings file
   - Now reads from `data/users/{user_id}/settings/browser_settings.json`
   - Correctly interprets `show_browser_during_sync` setting

3. **`/frontend/src/components/ScrapingScheduleEnhanced.tsx`**
   - `updateBrowserVisibility()` now saves both `headless` and `show_browser_during_sync` settings
   - `fetchBrowserSettings()` now checks for `show_browser_during_sync` field first

## How It Works

1. **User toggles "Show browser during sync"** in the UI
2. **Frontend saves** both `headless: false` and `show_browser_during_sync: true` to browser settings
3. **Settings are persisted** to `data/users/{user_id}/settings/browser_settings.json`
4. **Scheduler daemon reads** the JSON file when executing a scheduled sync
5. **Browser visibility** is set based on the `show_browser_during_sync` setting

## Testing Completed

✅ Created test script `/backend/scripts/test_browser_settings_save.py` that verifies:
- Browser settings API endpoints work correctly
- The `show_browser_during_sync` field is saved and retrieved properly
- JSON file contains the correct settings

✅ Verified that:
- Settings are saved to the correct JSON file location
- Scheduler daemon can read the settings from the JSON file
- The setting persists across sessions

## Next Steps for Bruce

1. **Enable browser visibility** in the UI:
   - Go to the Work Order Sync Configuration page
   - Toggle ON "Show browser during sync"
   - The setting will be saved automatically

2. **Restart the scheduler daemon**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 scheduler_daemon.py
   ```

3. **Test with manual sync**:
   - Click "Sync Now" to trigger a manual sync
   - The browser window should appear if the setting is enabled

4. **Monitor scheduled syncs**:
   - The browser will also be visible during automatic scheduled syncs
   - Check the scheduler logs to confirm the setting is being read correctly

## Additional Features Implemented

### Error Log Copying (Already Working)
- Failed syncs show a "Copy Error Log" button
- Clicking the button copies the full error details and stack trace to clipboard
- Error logs are stored in `data/logs/scraping_errors/` directory

### Timezone Display Fix (Already Working)
- All datetime fields now include 'Z' suffix to indicate UTC
- Frontend correctly interprets all times as UTC
- Time calculations are consistent across the UI

## Technical Details

The browser visibility setting is stored in the JSON file with this structure:
```json
{
  "headless": false,
  "browser_type": "chromium",
  "enable_screenshots": true,
  "enable_debug_mode": false,
  "viewport_width": 1280,
  "viewport_height": 720,
  "disable_images": false,
  "clear_cache_on_start": true,
  "show_browser_during_sync": true
}
```

When `show_browser_during_sync` is `true`, the scheduler will run Playwright with `headless=False`, making the browser window visible during sync operations.
