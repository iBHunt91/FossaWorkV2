```

#### Event Types & Colors
```python
Work Order: Blue (#4A90E2)
Filter Change: Orange (#F5A623)
Maintenance: Green (#7ED321)
Urgent: Red (#D0021B)
Completed: Gray (#9B9B9B)
```

## Example Usage

### Get Week View
```python
view = await scheduling_service.get_calendar_view(
    user_id="user123",
    view_type="week",
    start_date=date.today(),
    filters={"event_type": "work_order"}
)
# Returns: 7-day view with all work orders
```

### Schedule with Conflict Detection
```python
result = await scheduling_service.schedule_work_order(
    user_id="user123",
    work_order_id="WO-2024-001",
    requested_date=date.today(),
    requested_time=time(9, 0)
)
# Returns: Success or conflict with alternatives
```

### Optimize Daily Route
```python
optimization = await scheduling_service.optimize_daily_schedule(
    user_id="user123",
    target_date=date.today()
)
# Returns: Reordered schedule saving 35 minutes travel
```
