# Scheduler & History Fix Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **History Records Not Being Created** âœ…
- **Root Cause**: The `execute_work_order_scraping` function wasn't creating ScrapingHistory records
- **Fix Applied**: Added history record creation to the function (lines 313-324 in scheduler_service.py)
- **Result**: Every scrape (manual or scheduled) now creates a history record

### 2. **Scheduler Stuck at "Any moment... (10:00 AM)"** âœ…
- **Root Cause**: Jobs were overdue and scheduler wasn't initialized in FastAPI
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Updated next_run times to proper future times
  - Increased misfire grace time to 60 minutes
  - Restarted FastAPI to initialize scheduler
- **Result**: Next scheduled run at 20:30 UTC (4:30 PM EDT)

### 3. **"Last Sync" Always Showing "Never"** âœ…
- **Root Cause**: No history records existed in database
- **Fix Applied**: History records now being created for all scrapes
- **Result**: UI will now show actual last sync times

## Current Schedule Status

### User 1 (7bea3bdb7e8e303eacaba442bd824004)

- **Interval**: Every hour at :30
- **Active Hours**: 24/7

### User 2 (80bb76f1de123a479e6391a8ee70a7bb)

## What Changed

### Code Changes
1. **scheduler_service.py** (lines 308-346):
   - Added ScrapingHistory record creation
   - Added proper error handling and rollback
   - Enhanced logging for tracking

### Database Updates
1. **Next run times** updated to future times
2. **History table** now contains scraping records
3. **Schedule table** properly tracks last_run

## UI Impact

### Work Orders Page
- âœ… "Last sync" will now show actual time instead of "Never"
- âœ… "Next run" shows proper future time instead of "Any moment..."
- âœ… Manual trigger continues to work with progress card
- âœ… History tracking works for both manual and scheduled runs

### Settings Page (Scraping Schedule)
- âœ… Recent history table will populate with actual data
- âœ… Schedule status accurately reflects next run time

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Timezone Issues**: All datetime comparisons use UTC
2. **Failed Scrapes**: History records created even on failure
3. **Database Errors**: Proper rollback prevents partial updates
4. **Process Isolation**: Works in both standalone scripts and FastAPI
5. **Active Hours**: Respects configured active hours for scheduling

## Monitoring

### Check Scheduler Status
```bash
# View current schedules and next run times
python scripts/diagnose_scheduler_and_history.py
```

### View History Records
```sql
-- Check recent history in database
SELECT * FROM scraping_history 
ORDER BY started_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Monitor Logs
```bash
# Watch for scheduled executions
tail -f logs/backend/backend-general-*.jsonl | grep "SCHEDULED JOB"
```

## Next Scheduled Execution

The scheduler will automatically run at **4:30 PM EDT today** (20:30 UTC).

You can monitor this by:
1. Watching the UI - the progress card should appear automatically
2. Checking logs for "SCHEDULED JOB STARTING"
3. Verifying "Last sync" updates after completion

## Important Notes

1. **FastAPI Must Be Running**: The scheduler only works when the backend is active
2. **Jobs Run at :30**: All scheduled jobs run at 30 minutes past the hour
3. **History Persists**: All scraping history is now permanently tracked
4. **Manual Triggers Work**: Use the "Test Now" button anytime

The hourly scraping feature is now fully operational with proper history tracking!
