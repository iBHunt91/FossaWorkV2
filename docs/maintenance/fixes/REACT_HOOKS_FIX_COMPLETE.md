# React Hooks Error Fix Complete

## Issue
The Work Orders page was throwing a "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error, preventing the application from running properly.

## Root Cause
A `useMemo` hook was being called inside a `.map()` function at line 2528 of `WorkOrders.tsx`. React hooks must be called at the top level of the component and in the same order on every render - they cannot be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

## Fix Applied
Replaced the `useMemo` hook with an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):

```typescript
// Before (INCORRECT - hook inside map):
{useMemo(() => {
  const dispenserCount = getDispenserCount(workOrder);
  // ... rest of logic
}, [workOrder, getDispenserCount])}

// After (CORRECT - IIFE instead of hook):
{(() => {
  const dispenserCount = getDispenserCount(workOrder);
  // ... rest of logic
})()}
```

## Verification
1. Build completed successfully with no errors
2. No recent hook errors found in logs
3. Application runs without React hooks violations

## Lessons Learned
- Always call React hooks at the component level
- Never use hooks inside loops (`.map()`, `.forEach()`, etc.)
- Use IIFEs or extract logic to component-level hooks when needed
- The error message line numbers may refer to compiled code, not source code

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The application now runs without React hooks errors.
