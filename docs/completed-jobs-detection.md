# Completed Jobs Detection

## Overview

The Completed Jobs Detection feature enhances the schedule change detection system by filtering out jobs that have been intentionally completed rather than removed or rescheduled. This prevents unnecessary alerts when a job is simply completed as part of normal operations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Completed Jobs Scraping

A new scraper module (`completedJobsScrape.js`) was created to fetch the list of completed jobs from WorkFossa. This scraper:

- Logs in to WorkFossa using the user's credentials
- Navigates to the completed jobs page: `https://app.workfossa.com/app/work/list?work_visit_completion=all%7C%7CAll%20visits%20completed%7C%7CWork%20Visits%20Completed`
- Extracts job IDs from all completed work orders
- Stores these job IDs in a user-specific file (`completed_jobs.json`) using the `resolveUserFilePath` function from the userManager module

### 2. Schedule Comparison Enhancement

The schedule comparison process (`scheduleComparator.js`) was updated to:

- Check if a job marked as "removed" exists in the completed jobs list
- If a job is found in the completed jobs list, it is not reported as removed
- This filtering happens before any notifications are sent

### 3. Integration with Unified Scrape

The unified scraping process (`unified_scrape.js`) was modified to:

- Run the completed jobs scraper after the regular job scrape and before analyzing schedule changes
- Pass the appropriate user ID to ensure user-specific data handling

## Data Storage

Completed jobs are stored in user-specific directories:

- File format: `data/users/{userId}/completed_jobs.json`
- Data structure:
  ```json
  {
    "completedJobs": ["W-123456", "W-123457", "W-123458"],
    "metadata": {
      "timestamp": "2025-05-01T23:42:30.168Z",
      "user": "7bea3bdb7e8e303eacaba442bd824004"
    }
  }
  ```

## Testing

The feature can be tested using:

1. The test script: `node scripts/test-completed-jobs.js`
2. Running a manual scrape: `node scripts/unified_scrape.js manual`

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Implement a retention policy for completed jobs to prevent the list from growing indefinitely
2. Add a user interface to view/manage completed jobs
3. Include more metadata about completed jobs (completion date, technician, etc.) for reporting purposes
