# Credential Security Implementation

## Overview

The FossaWork V2 credential manager has been updated to enforce proper encryption for all stored credentials. There is **no fallback to base64 encoding** - proper encryption is mandatory.

## Security Features

### 1. Mandatory Cryptography Library
- The `cryptography` library (>=41.0.0) is **required** - no fallback allowed
- If the library is not installed, the application will fail to start with a clear error message
- Already included in `requirements.txt` as a core dependency

### 2. Master Key Requirement
- The `FOSSAWORK_MASTER_KEY` environment variable must be set
- Without it, no credential operations can be performed
- Generate a secure key with:
  ```bash
  python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
  ```

### 3. Encryption Details
- **Algorithm**: Fernet (symmetric encryption, AES 128-bit in CBC mode)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations
- **Per-User Keys**: Each user has a unique encryption key derived from the master key
- **File Permissions**: Credential files are created with 0600 permissions (owner read/write only)

## Implementation Changes

### Removed
- ❌ Base64 encoding fallback
- ❌ `CRYPTO_AVAILABLE` flag
- ❌ Ability to store credentials without encryption

### Added
- ✅ Hard requirement for cryptography library
- ✅ Clear error messages when requirements aren't met
- ✅ Encryption version tracking for future migrations
- ✅ Security test suite to verify enforcement

## Migration Guide

If you have existing credentials stored with base64 encoding (from earlier versions):

1. Set your master key:
   ```bash
   export FOSSAWORK_MASTER_KEY="your-secure-key-here"
   ```

2. Run the migration script to check for old credentials:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app/services/migrate_credentials.py --dry-run
   ```

3. If migration is needed, run without `--dry-run`:
   ```bash
   python app/services/migrate_credentials.py
   ```

## Testing Security

Run the security test suite to verify proper enforcement:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app/services/test_credential_security.py
```

This will verify:
- Cryptography library is required
- Master key is required
- Encryption works correctly
- No plaintext is stored

## Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. **Generate a strong master key**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
   ```

2. **Store the master key securely**:
   - Use environment variables (not in code)
   - Consider using a secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
   - Never commit the key to version control

3. **Backup the master key**:
   - Loss of the master key means loss of all encrypted credentials
   - Store backups in a secure, separate location

4. **Regular key rotation**:
   - Plan for periodic master key rotation
   - The migration script can help re-encrypt with new keys

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never log credentials** - The credential manager already avoids this
2. **Use HTTPS** - Ensure all API communication is encrypted in transit
3. **Implement rate limiting** - Prevent brute force attacks on the API
4. **Monitor access** - Log credential access attempts (success and failure)
5. **Regular security audits** - Review stored credentials and access patterns

## File Structure

```
backend/data/credentials/
├── user1.cred    # Encrypted credentials for user1
├── user2.cred    # Encrypted credentials for user2
└── ...
```

Each `.cred` file contains:
```json
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "encrypted_data": "gAAAAABh...",  // Fernet-encrypted JSON
  "created_at": "2025-01-14T10:00:00",
  "encryption_version": "1.0"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cryptography library not available"
```bash
pip install cryptography>=41.0.0
```

### "FOSSAWORK_MASTER_KEY not set"
Add to your `.env` file:
```
FOSSAWORK_MASTER_KEY=your-secure-key-here
```

### "Failed to decrypt credential data"
- Ensure you're using the same master key that encrypted the data
- Check if the credential file has been corrupted
- Run the migration script if upgrading from an old version

## Future Enhancements

1. **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Support** - For enterprise deployments
2. **Key Rotation Automation** - Scheduled re-encryption with new keys
3. **Multi-Master Key Support** - For high availability setups
4. **Audit Logging** - Detailed tracking of all credential operations
