  - Files to fix:
    - `backend/app/routes/work_orders.py`
    - `backend/app/routes/dispensers.py`
    - `backend/app/routes/filters.py`

### Phase 2: Critical Security (Week 2)
- [ ] **Day 4-5 + Day 1-2**: API Authentication (3-5 days)

    - `backend/app/core/idempotency.py`
  - Update batch processing logic

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)
- [ ] Security testing suite
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Staging deployment

## Working in the Security Fixes Worktree

### Navigate to Worktree
```bash
cd ../FossaWorkV2-security-fixes
```

### Activate Python Environment
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Run Development Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm run dev
```

### Making Changes
1. Implement fixes in the worktree
2. Test thoroughly
3. Commit changes to feature branch
4. Push to remote when ready for review

## Testing Commands

### Security Testing
```bash
# Install tools
pip install bandit safety

# Run security scan
bandit -r backend/

# Check dependencies
safety check
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run N+1 query tests
python -m pytest tests/backend/test_n_plus_one.py -v

# Load testing
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:8000
```

## Progress Tracking

### Completed
- [x] Created worktree
- [x] Set up environment
- [x] Created implementation plan

### In Progress
- [ ] Security headers implementation

### Not Started
- [ ] N+1 query fixes
- [ ] API authentication
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Distributed locking
- [ ] Testing suite

## Notes
- Start with security headers for quick win
- Use feature flags for gradual auth rollout
- Monitor performance impact of eager loading
- Document all security decisions
