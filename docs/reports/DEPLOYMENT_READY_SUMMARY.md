## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

### 2. Configuration
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values:
# - Set SECRET_KEY to a secure random string
# - Configure SMTP settings for email
# - Add Pushover API token
# - Set DATABASE_URL for production
```

### 3. Database Setup
```bash
# For SQLite (development)
# Database will be created automatically

# For PostgreSQL (production)
# Create database first, then:
alembic upgrade head  # When migrations are configured
```

### 4. Run Application
```bash
# Development
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Production
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```
