# Monitoring and Alerting System Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive monitoring and alerting infrastructure has been implemented for FossaWork V2 to provide real-time visibility into application health, performance, and security events.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MetricsCollector** (`app/monitoring/metrics_collector.py`)
   - Collects application, system, and security metrics
   - Provides real-time performance tracking
   - Integrates with database and system monitoring

2. **AlertManager** (`app/monitoring/alert_manager.py`)
   - Manages alert rules and notifications
   - Supports multiple notification channels (email, pushover, desktop)
   - Implements cooldown periods and severity levels

3. **HealthChecker** (`app/monitoring/health_check.py`)
   - Comprehensive health checks for all system components
   - Detects degraded performance and failures
   - Provides detailed diagnostics

4. **SecurityMonitor** (`app/monitoring/security_monitor.py`)
   - Real-time security threat detection
   - IP blocking and rate limiting
   - Pattern-based attack detection

5. **MonitoringMiddleware** (`app/middleware/monitoring_middleware.py`)
   - Request-level metrics collection
   - Security event tracking
   - Performance monitoring

## Features

### Metrics Collection

**Application Metrics:**
- Request rate and response times
- Error rates and status code distribution
- Endpoint performance statistics
- Uptime tracking

**System Metrics:**
- CPU and memory usage
- Disk space and I/O
- Network statistics
- Process-specific metrics

**Database Metrics:**
- Connection pool statistics
- Query performance
- Table sizes and cache hit rates

**Security Metrics:**
- Authentication failures
- Blocked IP addresses
- Security incident counts
- Threat level assessment

### Health Checks

The system includes health checks for:
- âœ… Database connectivity and performance
- âœ… WorkFossa API availability
- âœ… File system access and disk space
- âœ… Memory usage monitoring
- âœ… Playwright browser automation
- âœ… Background job scheduler

### Alert Rules

**Default Alert Rules:**
1. **High CPU Usage** (>90%) - Warning, 15min cooldown
2. **High Memory Usage** (>90%) - Warning, 15min cooldown
3. **High Error Rate** (>10%) - Critical, 30min cooldown
4. **Database Pool Exhausted** (>90% used) - Critical, 10min cooldown
5. **Security Events Spike** (>100/hour) - Critical, 60min cooldown
6. **Authentication Failures** (>50/hour) - Critical, 30min cooldown
7. **Rate Limiting Active** (>100/hour) - Warning, 60min cooldown
8. **Slow Response Times** (>1000ms avg) - Warning, 30min cooldown
9. **Low Disk Space** (>90%) - Critical, 60min cooldown
10. **Application Restart** (<5min uptime) - Info, 5min cooldown

### Security Monitoring

**Threat Detection Patterns:**
- ðŸ”’ SQL injection attempts
- ðŸ”’ XSS (Cross-site scripting) attacks
- ðŸ”’ Path traversal attempts
- ðŸ”’ Command injection patterns
- ðŸ”’ Authentication bypass attempts

**Automated Response:**
- IP blocking for critical threats
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Brute force detection
- DDoS mitigation

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/status` - Overall system status

### Admin-Only Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/health/detailed` - Comprehensive health report
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/metrics` - All application metrics
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/metrics/application` - App-specific metrics
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/metrics/system` - System resource metrics
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/metrics/security` - Security metrics
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/alerts/history` - Alert history
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/security/status` - Security status
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/security/incidents` - Incident reports
- `POST /api/v1/monitoring/security/block-ip` - Manual IP blocking
- `POST /api/v1/monitoring/security/unblock-ip` - IP unblocking
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/dashboard` - Dashboard data

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Monitoring settings
MONITORING_ENABLED=true
METRICS_RETENTION_HOURS=24
ALERT_EMAIL_ENABLED=true
ALERT_PUSHOVER_ENABLED=false

# Security monitoring
SECURITY_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
IP_BLOCKING_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true
```

### Integration with Main Application

The monitoring system is integrated via middleware in `app/main.py`:

```python
from app.middleware.monitoring_middleware import MonitoringMiddleware

# Add monitoring middleware
app.add_middleware(MonitoringMiddleware)

# Include monitoring routes
app.include_router(monitoring_router)
```

## Notification Channels

### Email Notifications
- Critical alerts sent via SMTP
- Detailed incident reports
- System health summaries

### Pushover Notifications
- Instant mobile alerts
- Priority-based messaging
- Critical security events

### Desktop Notifications
- Local system notifications
- Development environment alerts

### Log Notifications
- Structured logging integration
- Alert history preservation
- Debugging support

## Performance Monitoring

### Response Time Tracking
- Per-endpoint response times
- Average and percentile calculations
- Slow query detection

### Error Rate Monitoring
- HTTP status code tracking
- Error pattern analysis
- Failure trend detection

### Resource Usage
- CPU and memory monitoring
- Database connection tracking
- File system usage alerts

## Security Incident Response

### Automated Actions
1. **Pattern Detection** â†’ Block IP immediately
2. **Brute Force** â†’ Temporary IP ban (1-24 hours)
3. **Rate Limiting** â†’ Throttle requests
4. **Critical Alerts** â†’ Immediate notifications

### Manual Response

- Performance metrics visualization
- Security threat level indicators
- Alert summary and history
- Top endpoints and error patterns
- System resource usage graphs

## Maintenance

### Log Retention
- Metrics: 1000 entries per type (configurable)
- Incidents: 1000 entries (rolling window)
- Alert history: 7 days default

### Performance Optimization
- Deque-based circular buffers for metrics
- Async health checks with timeouts
- Efficient pattern matching
- Minimal overhead middleware

## Future Enhancements

1. **Grafana Integration** - Visual dashboards
2. **Prometheus Metrics** - Industry-standard metrics export
3. **Machine Learning** - Anomaly detection
4. **Distributed Tracing** - Request flow tracking
5. **Custom Alert Rules** - User-defined conditions
6. **Webhook Notifications** - Integration with external systems

## Testing

Comprehensive monitoring tests are included in the security test suite:
- Health check validation
- Metrics collection accuracy
- Alert rule functionality
- Security pattern detection

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Settings
```python
# High-performance monitoring for production
MONITORING_MIDDLEWARE_ENABLED = True
SECURITY_MONITORING_STRICT = True
ALERT_CHANNELS = ["email", "pushover"]
METRICS_SAMPLING_RATE = 1.0  # Sample all requests
```

### Development Settings
```python
# Lighter monitoring for development
MONITORING_MIDDLEWARE_ENABLED = True
SECURITY_MONITORING_STRICT = False
ALERT_CHANNELS = ["log"]
METRICS_SAMPLING_RATE = 0.1  # Sample 10% of requests
```

## Success Metrics
