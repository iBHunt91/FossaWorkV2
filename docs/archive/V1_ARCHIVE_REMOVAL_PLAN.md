# V1 Archive Removal Plan

## Overview
The `V1-Archive-2025-01-07` directory contains 1.3GB of old V1 system code that should be removed from the active codebase.

## Security Issue
This archive contains exposed credentials in a .env file that need to be addressed immediately.

## Size Impact
- Current size: 1.3GB (46% of total repository)
- After removal: Repository will be reduced to ~1.5GB

## Contents
- Complete V1 FossaWork system
- node_modules directories
- Backup files and development artifacts
- Hunt Notes and documentation
- Configuration files

## Removal Strategy
1. **Backup important documentation** from Hunt Notes if needed
2. **Extract any useful configuration patterns** for V2 system
3. **Remove the entire directory** to free up space
4. **Add to .gitignore** to prevent future large archives

## Manual Action Required
Due to permission restrictions, this directory needs to be manually removed:

```bash
# After backing up any needed files:
rm -rf V1-Archive-2025-01-07
```

## Post-Removal Tasks
1. Update .gitignore to prevent large archives
2. Verify no V1 dependencies in V2 system
3. Update documentation references
4. Run security scan to ensure no credentials remain
