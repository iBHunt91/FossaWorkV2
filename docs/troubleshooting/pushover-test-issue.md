# Pushover Test Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## Status: RESOLVED (January 29, 2025)
This issue has been fixed. The documentation below is kept for historical reference.

## Problem (Historical)
- Pushover notifications were sent successfully (received on device)
- UI showed test as failed with "Unknown error occurred"
- Debug console.log statements didn't appear

## Root Cause (Resolved)
The frontend code wasn't interpreting the API response correctly due to a response structure mismatch.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Check Actual API Response (Recommended First Step)
```bash
# In browser DevTools:
1. Open Network tab
2. Clear network log
3. Click Pushover test button
4. Find request to /api/notifications/test/pushover
5. Check Response tab for actual JSON structure
```

### 2. Browser Console Test
Paste this in browser console:
```javascript
// See scripts/browser-pushover-test.js
```

### 3. Temporary Override
Paste this in browser console to fix the button behavior:
```javascript
// See scripts/temporary-pushover-fix.js
```

### 4. Nuclear Reset
```bash
# Run the fix script
./scripts/fix-dev-environment.sh
```

## Expected API Response
The backend should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Test notification sent via pushover",
  "results": {
    "email": false,
    "desktop": false,
    "pushover": true
  }
}
```

## Permanent Fix
Once we know the actual response structure, update Settings.tsx line 1072:
```typescript
// Current check
if (result.success && result.results?.pushover === true)

// May need to be something like:
if (result.success === true) // Just check top-level success
```

## Development Environment Issues
If code changes aren't being picked up:
1. Kill all node processes: `pkill -f node`
2. Clear Vite cache: `rm -rf frontend/node_modules/.vite`
3. Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R
4. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
