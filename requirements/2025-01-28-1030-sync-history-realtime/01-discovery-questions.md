# Discovery Questions

Based on the codebase analysis, I've identified that the sync history feature already exists and uses polling for updates. These questions will help clarify what specific real-time behavior needs to be fixed or enhanced.

## Q1: Is the issue that the sync history table doesn't update automatically when a sync completes (requiring page refresh)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (most common real-time update issue is stale data requiring manual refresh)

## Q2: Should the sync history update immediately when a manual sync is triggered via the "Sync Now" button?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users expect immediate feedback when they initiate actions)

## Q3: Is the current 10-second polling interval too slow for the desired real-time experience?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (10 seconds can feel sluggish for active monitoring)

## Q4: Should the progress indicator show more granular updates during an active sync operation?
**Default if unknown:** No (current progress tracking may be sufficient if history is the main concern)

## Q5: Are there specific sync events (errors, completions) that should trigger immediate UI updates?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (critical events like errors should be shown immediately)
