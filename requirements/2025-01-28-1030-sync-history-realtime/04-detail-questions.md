# Detail Questions

Now that I understand the codebase architecture and current implementation, here are specific technical questions about the expected system behavior:

## Q6: Should the sync history section be collapsible (with expand/collapse toggle) to save space when not actively monitoring?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (follows the pattern of other settings sections being collapsible for better organization)

## Q7: When a scheduled sync runs in the background, should it also update the progress in real-time if the settings page is open?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users monitoring the settings page should see all sync activity, not just manual syncs)

## Q8: Should failed sync attempts show the full error details inline, or just a summary with a "View Details" option?
**Default if unknown:** No (show summary with "View Details" to keep the UI clean, matching current error log modal pattern)

## Q9: Should the progress updates include a live count of work orders being processed (e.g., "Processing work order 15 of 47")?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (matches the granular progress shown on the work order page that the user likes)

## Q10: Should we add a visual indicator (like a pulsing dot) next to "Sync Schedule" in the settings when a sync is actively running?
**Default if unknown:** No (the progress bar and status in the expanded section should be sufficient visual feedback)
