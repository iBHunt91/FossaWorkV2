## Original Request
Fix recent sync history in work order sync configuration in the settings page to update in real time

## Interpreted Need
The recent sync history section in the work order sync configuration area of the settings page is not updating in real-time when sync operations occur. Users need to see immediate feedback when syncs happen without having to refresh the page.

## Key Areas to Investigate
- Settings page sync history component
- Work order sync functionality
- Real-time update mechanisms
- WebSocket or polling implementations
- State management for sync history
