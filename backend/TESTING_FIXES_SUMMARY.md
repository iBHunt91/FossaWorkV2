# Backend Testing Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WorkFossa Connection Test
**Issue:** Test was looking for credentials in `data/users/{user_id}/credentials.json` but the system actually stores encrypted credentials in `data/credentials/{user_id}.cred`.

**Fix:** Updated the test to use the `CredentialManager` service to properly retrieve and validate encrypted credentials.

**Result:** Test now correctly detects existing WorkFossa credentials and validates connectivity.

### 2. Email Configuration Test
**Issue:** Test was looking for settings in `data/users/{user_id}/settings.json` but the system stores SMTP settings in `data/users/{user_id}/settings/smtp.json`.

**Fix:** Updated the test to:
- Check the correct location for SMTP settings
- Fall back to legacy locations if needed
- Check database for notification preferences
- Properly validate required SMTP fields

**Result:** Test correctly reports email configuration status.

### 3. Pushover Configuration Test
**Issue:** Similar to email, test was looking in wrong location for Pushover settings.

**Fix:** Updated the test to:
- Check multiple possible locations for Pushover settings
- Check database for notification preferences
- Validate Pushover user key requirements

**Result:** Test correctly reports Pushover configuration status.

## Current Status

For user `bruce.hunt@owlservices.com`:
- ✅ **WorkFossa Credentials:** Valid and working
- ❌ **Email Settings:** Not configured (no SMTP settings)
- ❌ **Pushover Settings:** Not configured (no Pushover credentials)

This is the expected behavior - the user has successfully authenticated with WorkFossa but hasn't configured notification settings yet.

## Environment Requirements

The testing endpoints require the following environment variables:
- `SECRET_KEY`: For JWT token generation
- `FOSSAWORK_MASTER_KEY`: For decrypting stored credentials

These should be set in the `.env` file or exported before running the backend.

## Next Steps

1. Users can configure email notifications through the settings UI
2. Users can configure Pushover notifications through the settings UI
3. The notification tests will pass once users have configured their notification preferences
