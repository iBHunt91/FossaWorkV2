# Notification Configuration Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Methods in UserManagementService
**Problem:** The notification_manager was calling `set_user_preference` and `get_user_preference` methods that didn't exist.

**Fix:** Added synchronous wrapper methods to UserManagementService:
- `get_user_preference()` - Retrieves user preferences from database
- `set_user_preference()` - Updates user preferences in database

### 2. Email Configuration
**Status:** ✅ Fully Configured

**Settings Applied:**
- SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com:587
- Username: fossamonitor@gmail.com
- Password: papi njro friq hmyh (app password)
- TLS: Enabled
- From Email: fossamonitor@gmail.com

**Location:** `/data/users/7bea3bdb7e8e303eacaba442bd824004/settings/smtp.json`

### 3. Pushover Configuration
**Status:** ⚠️ Partially Configured (needs user key)

**Current State:**
- Pushover is enabled in the database
- Placeholder user key set: "YOUR_PUSHOVER_USER_KEY"
- User needs to provide their actual Pushover user key

## What the User Needs to Do

### To Complete Pushover Setup:

1. **Get your Pushover User Key:**
   - Go to https://pushover.net/
   - Log in to your account
   - Find your User Key on the main page (looks like: u1x3q7o9n2m5k8j6)

2. **Update in the UI:**
   - Go to Settings → Notifications in the FossaWork app
   - Enter your Pushover User Key
   - Save the settings

3. **Test the Configuration:**
   - Use the Testing Dashboard to verify both Email and Pushover are working
   - Send a test notification to confirm

## Database Updates Made

1. **user_preferences table:**
   - Updated `notification_settings` category with email and pushover configuration

2. **users table:**
   - Updated `notification_settings` column for compatibility with testing endpoints

## Testing Script

Created `/scripts/test_notification_config.py` to verify configuration status.

Run it with: `python3 scripts/test_notification_config.py`

## Next Steps

1. User provides Pushover user key through the UI
2. Test both email and Pushover notifications
3. Configure notification preferences (which events trigger which channel)
4. Set up digest timing preferences if needed
