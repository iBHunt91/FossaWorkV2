# Scheduler Implementation Backup - January 26, 2025

This directory contains a complete backup of the FossaWork V2 scheduler implementation before the transition to a standalone scheduler architecture.

## Backup Contents

### Backend Services (`services/`)
- `scheduler_service.py` - Main scheduler service with APScheduler integration
- `simple_scheduler_service.py` - Simplified scheduler implementation
- `scheduler_service_wrapper.py` - Wrapper for scheduler functionality
- `scheduler_service_mock.py` - Mock scheduler for testing
- `advanced_scheduling_service.py` - Advanced scheduling features
- `filter_scheduling_service.py` - Filter-specific scheduling
- `schedule_detection.py` - Schedule detection utilities

### Backend Routes (`routes/`)
- `scraping_schedules.py` - Main API endpoints for scheduling
- `advanced_scheduling.py` - Advanced scheduling endpoints
- `filter_scheduling.py` - Filter scheduling endpoints
- `schedule_detection.py` - Schedule detection endpoints

### Middleware (`middleware/`)
- `schedule_debug.py` - Debug middleware for scheduler

### Frontend Components (`frontend/`)
- `ScrapingSchedule.tsx` - Main scheduling UI component
- `ScrapingStatus.tsx` - Status display component
- `ScrapingStatusContext.tsx` - React context for scraping status

### Tests (`tests/`)
- Various unit tests for scheduler functionality
- `test_scheduler_methods.py` (from root)

## Original Architecture

The original implementation used:
1. **APScheduler** - Python job scheduling library integrated with FastAPI
2. **SQLAlchemy** - Database ORM for storing schedule configurations
3. **WebSocket** - Real-time status updates to frontend
4. **React Context** - State management for UI updates

## Key Features Preserved

1. **Schedule Types:**
   - One-time schedules
   - Daily schedules
   - Weekly schedules
   - Monthly schedules
   - Custom cron schedules

2. **Job Management:**
   - Create/update/delete schedules
   - Pause/resume functionality
   - Job status tracking
   - Error handling and retries

3. **Integration Points:**
   - Work order scraping
   - Dispenser data collection
   - Filter calculations
   - Email notifications

## Migration Notes

The new standalone scheduler architecture aims to:
- Simplify the codebase by removing APScheduler complexity
- Improve reliability with a separate daemon process
- Reduce frontend complexity by removing real-time updates
- Make the system easier to debug and maintain

## Restoration Instructions

To restore this implementation:
1. Copy all files from their respective directories back to the main codebase
2. Ensure APScheduler is in requirements.txt
3. Re-enable WebSocket endpoints in main.py
4. Restore frontend real-time update logic
