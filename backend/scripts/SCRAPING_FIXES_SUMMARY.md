# Work Order Scraping Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. NotificationManager Error ✅
**Problem:** `NotificationManager.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'user_id'`
**Solution:** 
- Fixed in `scheduler_daemon.py` to use `get_notification_manager(db)` factory function
- Added proper import for `NotificationTrigger`
- Wrapped notification sending in try/except to handle failures gracefully

### 2. Deprecation Warnings ✅
**Problem:** `datetime.utcnow()` is deprecated
**Solution:** 
- Replaced all instances of `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- Fixed timezone comparison issues in scheduler daemon

### 3. Timezone Comparison Error ✅
**Problem:** `can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`
**Solution:** 
- Added proper timezone handling in `should_run_schedule` method
- Ensured consistent timezone handling throughout the scheduler

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### 1. Work Order Scraping Not Finding Elements ❗
**Problem:** "No work order elements found with any selector"
**Symptoms:**
- Page size dropdown not being found
- Work order table elements not detected
- Only finding 0 work orders

**Possible Causes:**
1. WorkFossa UI has changed since the selectors were written
2. Login might not be fully completing before scraping attempts
3. Page might require additional wait time or different loading strategy
4. Selectors might be outdated

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the login test script: `python scripts/test_workfossa_login.py`
2. Examine the saved HTML content in `/tmp/workfossa_work_orders.html`
3. Update selectors based on current WorkFossa HTML structure
4. Add more robust wait conditions

## Created Scripts

1. **`scripts/debug_work_order_scraping.py`** - Detailed debugging of work order scraping with visible browser
2. **`scripts/test_workfossa_login.py`** - Simple login test to verify credentials work
3. **`scripts/restart_scheduler.sh`** - Quick script to restart the scheduler daemon

## How to Test

1. **Test Login First:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ibhunt/Documents/GitHub/FossaWorkV2/backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   python scripts/test_workfossa_login.py
   ```

2. **Debug Work Order Scraping:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/debug_work_order_scraping.py
   ```

3. **Check Scheduler Logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f scheduler_daemon.log
   ```

4. **Restart Scheduler After Fixes:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/restart_scheduler.sh
   ```

## Current Status

- ✅ Scheduler daemon is running without errors
- ✅ Notification system properly configured
- ✅ All deprecation warnings fixed
- ❗ Work order scraping still needs selector updates
- ❗ Need to verify WorkFossa login completes successfully

## Recommended Actions

1. Run the test scripts to understand current WorkFossa HTML structure
2. Update selectors in `workfossa_scraper.py` based on findings
3. Add more robust wait conditions for dynamic content
4. Consider adding retry logic for page size changes
5. Implement better error messages when scraping fails
