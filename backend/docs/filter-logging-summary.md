- Added error handling with comprehensive logging

**Log Tags Added:** `[FILTER_CALC]`, `[FILTER_VALIDATE]`

### 2. `/backend/app/services/filter_calculator.py`
- Added logging import and logger initialization
- Enhanced main `calculate_filters` method with step-by-step logging
- Enhanced work order processing with individual job logging
- Enhanced dispenser filter calculation with detailed debugging
- Enhanced fuel grade processing with rule application logging
- Enhanced summary generation with compilation logging

**Log Tags Added:** `[FILTER_CALC_SERVICE]`

### 3. `/backend/app/routes/work_orders.py`
- Enhanced `get_work_orders` endpoint with query and result logging
- Enhanced dispenser scraping endpoints with detailed progress logging
- Enhanced background scraping tasks with comprehensive error logging

**Log Tags Added:** `[WORK_ORDERS]`, `[DISPENSER_SCRAPE]`, `[DISPENSER_SCRAPE_BG]`

## üìÑ Documentation Created

### 1. `/backend/docs/filter-logging-improvements.md`
- Comprehensive documentation of all logging improvements
- Examples of log message formats and debugging workflows
- Common issues to look for and troubleshooting steps

### 2. `/backend/docs/filter-logging-summary.md`
- This summary document

### 3. `/backend/scripts/testing/test_filter_logging.py`
- Test script to verify logging functionality
- Simulates filter calculations with sample data
- Tests various scenarios including edge cases and error conditions

## üß™ Testing Results

The test script confirms all logging is working correctly:

```
‚úÖ Filter Calculation Completed Successfully!
üìä Results:
  Summary Items: 3
  Detail Items: 2
  Warnings: 1
  Total Filters: 7
  Total Boxes: 3
```

### Key Log Messages Verified:

1. **Input Validation**: `[FILTER_CALC_SERVICE] Input: 2 work orders, 3 dispensers`
2. **Data Processing**: `[FILTER_CALC_SERVICE] Valid work orders: 2/2`
3. **Dispenser Grouping**: `[FILTER_CALC_SERVICE] Dispensers grouped for 2 stores`
4. **Individual Processing**: `[FILTER_CALC_SERVICE] Processing job 12345, store 1234, service 2861`
5. **Filter Calculations**: `[FILTER_CALC_SERVICE] Job 12345 total filters: {'400MB-10': 3, '400HS-10': 2}`
6. **Final Results**: `[FILTER_CALC_SERVICE] Final results: 7 filters, 3 boxes`

## üîç Debugging Capabilities

The logging now provides complete visibility into:

### Request Level:
- Incoming filter calculation requests
- Work order and dispenser data counts
- Parameter validation
- Override configurations

### Processing Level:
- Work order validation and filtering
- Dispenser grouping by store
- Service code requirement checking
- Store chain determination

### Calculation Level:
- Individual dispenser processing
- Fuel grade analysis and rule application
- Filter type determination
- Part number lookups
- Quantity calculations

### Result Level:
- Filter summary compilation
- Box calculations
- Warning generation
- Final totals

## üö® Error Detection

The logging will now clearly identify:

- **Missing Data**: When work orders exist but no dispensers are found
- **Validation Issues**: Invalid service codes, missing required fields
- **Processing Errors**: Failures in calculation logic
- **Data Structure Problems**: Malformed work order or dispenser data

## üìù Log Format

All log messages use consistent prefixes for easy filtering:
- `[FILTER_CALC]` - API endpoint level
- `[FILTER_CALC_SERVICE]` - Service calculation level  
- `[WORK_ORDERS]` - Work order retrieval
- `[DISPENSER_SCRAPE]` - Dispenser scraping operations

## üéØ Next Steps

When debugging filter calculation issues:

1. **Check the logs** for the relevant prefixes
2. **Follow the data flow** from request ‚Üí validation ‚Üí processing ‚Üí results
3. **Look for warnings** about missing data or validation failures
4. **Verify dispenser data** is available for the work order stores
5. **Check service codes** are correctly mapped to filter requirements

The comprehensive logging will now provide clear visibility into every step of the filter calculation pipeline, making it much easier to identify where and why filter data might not be appearing correctly.
