# Authentication Security Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical security vulnerabilities in the FossaWork V2 backend by implementing proper JWT authentication and removing dummy authentication code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dummy Authentication
- **File**: `app/middleware/auth_middleware.py`
  - Removed dummy `get_current_user` function that always returned a fake user
  - Removed `PUBLIC_PREFIXES` that exposed sensitive endpoints:
    - `/api/v1/work-orders` - Work order data
    - `/api/v1/users` - User management 
    - `/api/v1/credentials` - Sensitive credentials

### 2. Updated Authentication Dependencies
- **File**: `app/auth/dependencies.py`
  - Now properly imports `get_current_user` from security module
  - No longer uses dummy implementation

### 3. Fixed User Model
- **File**: `app/models/user_models.py`
  - Added `is_active` property (returns True for all authenticated users)
  - Added `is_admin` property (configurable based on requirements)
  - These properties are required by the authentication system

### 4. Protected Critical Endpoints

#### Work Orders (`app/routes/work_orders.py`)
- Added authentication to:
  - `GET /api/v1/work-orders/` - List work orders
  - `GET /api/v1/work-orders/{id}` - Get specific work order
  - `GET /api/v1/work-orders/scrape/progress/{user_id}` - Scraping progress
  - `POST /api/v1/work-orders/scrape` - Trigger scraping
- Added user validation to ensure users can only access their own data

#### Credentials (`app/routes/credentials.py`)
- Added authentication to:
  - `POST /api/v1/credentials/workfossa` - Save credentials
  - `GET /api/v1/credentials/workfossa` - Get credentials
  - `GET /api/v1/credentials/workfossa/decrypt` - Get decrypted credentials
  - `DELETE /api/v1/credentials/workfossa` - Delete credentials
  - `POST /api/v1/credentials/workfossa/test` - Test credentials
  - `GET /api/v1/credentials/security/info` - Security info
- Added user validation for all credential operations

#### Settings (`app/routes/settings.py`)
- Fixed import to use proper authentication module
- All settings endpoints now require authentication

#### Automation (`app/routes/automation.py`)
- Added authentication import
- Ready for endpoint protection (needs manual update due to complexity)

### 5. Authentication Flow
The system now properly:
1. Validates JWT tokens in the middleware for all non-public endpoints
2. Decodes JWT to get user information from the database
3. Passes authenticated user object to route handlers
4. Validates that users can only access their own data

### 6. Public Endpoints (No Auth Required)
Only these endpoints remain public:
- `/` - Root
- `/health` - Health check
- `/api/auth/login` - Login endpoint
- `/api/auth/verify` - Verification endpoint
- `/api/auth/check` - Auth check
- `/api/setup/status` - Setup status
- `/api/setup/initialize` - Initial setup
- `/api/v1/logs/write` - Frontend logging
- `/docs`, `/openapi.json`, `/redoc` - API documentation

## Testing

Created test script: `scripts/test_authentication.py`
- Tests public endpoints work without auth
- Tests protected endpoints require auth (return 401)
- Tests login and authenticated requests
- Checks middleware is active

## Security Improvements

1. **No More Dummy Auth**: Real JWT validation is enforced
2. **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
3. **Proper Error Codes**: 401 for unauthenticated, 403 for unauthorized
4. **Token Validation**: Tokens are validated on every request
5. **Secure by Default**: All endpoints require auth unless explicitly public

## Remaining Work

### Critical (Do Immediately)
1. **Automation Routes**: Many automation endpoints still need protection
2. **Form Automation Routes**: Need authentication added
3. **Schedule Detection Routes**: Need authentication added
4. **URL Generation Routes**: Need authentication added
5. **Notification Routes**: Need authentication added

### Important Notes
- The JWT secret key MUST be set in the `.env` file
- Never expose the dummy authentication code again
- Always validate user ownership of resources
- Test all endpoints after adding authentication

## Implementation Pattern
For any remaining unprotected endpoints, follow this pattern:

```python
# Import
from ..auth.dependencies import require_auth

# Add to route
@router.get("/endpoint")
async def endpoint_handler(
    user_id: str,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(require_auth)  # Add this
):
    # Add validation
    if current_user.id != user_id and not current_user.is_admin:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Not authorized")
    
    # ... rest of handler
```

This ensures proper authentication and authorization for all sensitive operations.
