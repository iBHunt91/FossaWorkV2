# Logging Improvements - January 2025

## Overview
Fixed logging issues in the scraping schedules API routes and enhanced logging throughout the scheduler service for better debugging and monitoring.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect LoggingService Method Calls
**Problem**: The `scraping_schedules.py` route was calling non-existent methods on the LoggingService class:
- `await logging_service.log_info()` 
- `await logging_service.log_error()`
- `await logging_service.log_warning()`
- `await logging_service.log_event()`

**Solution**: Updated to use the correct logging pattern:
```python
# Before (incorrect):
logging_service = LoggingService()
await logging_service.log_info("message", db=db)

# After (correct):
logger = get_logger("api.scraping_schedules")
logger.info("message")
log_automation_event("event_type", {"key": "value"})
```

### 2. Database Model Field Mismatches
**Problem**: The scheduler service was trying to update non-existent fields in the ScrapingSchedule model:
- `last_run_at` (should be `last_run`)
- `last_run_success` (field doesn't exist)
- `last_run_message` (field doesn't exist)

**Solution**: Updated to use the correct fields from the model:
- `last_run` - DateTime field for last execution
- `consecutive_failures` - Counter for tracking failures

## Enhancements Added

### 1. Comprehensive Scheduler Service Logging
Added detailed logging throughout the scheduler service lifecycle:

#### Initialization
- Log database URL being used
- Log scheduler type (full APScheduler vs simple database-only)
- Log number of jobs restored from database
- Log each step of the initialization process

#### Job Management
- Log when jobs are added with full parameters
- Log trigger type (cron vs interval) and configuration
- Log next run time when jobs are scheduled
- Log all job state changes (pause/resume)
- Log job removal operations

#### Job Execution
- Enhanced job event handling with automation event logging
- Log job failures with full exception details
- Log missed job executions
- Track execution statistics

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around scheduler restoration
- Continue operation even if individual schedules fail to restore
- Graceful fallback to simple scheduler if APScheduler unavailable
- Better error messages with context

### 3. Simple Scheduler Service Logging
Enhanced the fallback simple scheduler with:
- Clear warnings that it's database-only (no automatic execution)
- Detailed parameter logging for all operations
- Warnings when schedules are created but won't auto-execute

### 4. Main Application Startup
Improved scheduler initialization in `main.py`:
- Try to import full scheduler first, with fallback to simple
- Log which scheduler type is being used
- Handle initialization failures gracefully
- Continue application startup even if scheduler fails

## New Test Scripts

### 1. Scheduler Initialization Test
`scripts/test_scheduler_initialization.py`
- Tests scheduler import and initialization
- Verifies all scheduler operations
- Shows detailed status at each step
- Helps diagnose scheduler issues

### 2. Manual Scrape Trigger
`scripts/manual_scrape_trigger.py`
- Allows manual triggering of work order scraping
- Useful when scheduler isn't running
- Shows detailed scraping results
- Command: `python scripts/manual_scrape_trigger.py <user_id>`

## Logging Patterns

### API Routes
```python
# Import at top
from ..services.logging_service import get_logger, log_automation_event, log_error

# Initialize logger
logger = get_logger("api.route_name")

# Use throughout
logger.info("Info message")
logger.debug("Debug message")
logger.warning("Warning message")
logger.error("Error message", exc_info=True)

# For automation events
log_automation_event("event_type", {"key": "value"})

# For errors
log_error(exception, "Context message")
```

### Services
```python
# Import
from ..services.logging_service import get_logger

# Initialize
logger = get_logger("service.name")

# Use standard Python logging
logger.info(f"Message with {variable}")
logger.exception("Error with traceback")
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logs show exactly what the scheduler is doing
2. **Error Tracking**: All failures are logged with context and stack traces  
3. **Monitoring**: Can track scheduler health and job execution patterns
4. **Fallback Support**: Clear indication when running in degraded mode
5. **User Visibility**: Automation events provide user-facing activity logs

## Future Improvements

1. Add metrics collection for scheduler performance
2. Implement log aggregation for multi-instance deployments
3. Add alerting for repeated job failures
4. Create dashboard for scheduler monitoring
5. Implement log rotation and archival
