# Visit Number Field Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully added the `visit_number` field to the FossaWork V2 system. This field captures the visit ID number from WorkFossa URLs (e.g., "131650" from `/visits/131650/`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Data Model (`app/services/workfossa_scraper.py`)
- ✅ `WorkOrderData` dataclass already had `visit_number` field defined
- ✅ Field is extracted from visit URLs in `_extract_visit_info()` method (lines 1828, 1872)

### 2. Database Schema (`app/core_models.py`)
- ✅ Added `visit_number` column to `WorkOrder` model:
  ```python
  visit_number = Column(String(50), nullable=True)  # Visit number from URL
  ```

### 3. Database Migration
- ✅ Created migration script: `scripts/migrations/add_visit_number_column.py`
- ✅ Successfully ran migration to add column to existing database

### 4. API Layer (`app/routes/work_orders.py`)
- ✅ Updated `perform_scrape()` to save visit_number when creating work orders (line 638)
- ✅ Updated `perform_scrape()` to save visit_number when updating work orders (line 601)
- ✅ Added visit_number to API responses in `get_work_orders()` (line 218)
- ✅ Added visit_number to API responses in `get_work_order()` (line 313)

### 5. Frontend TypeScript (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- ✅ Added `visit_number?: string` to WorkOrder interface (line 116)

## Testing
- Created test scripts to verify implementation:
  - `scripts/check_visit_number_fields.py` - Checks WorkOrderData class
  - `scripts/test_visit_number_extraction.py` - Tests extraction logic
  - `scripts/test_visit_number_complete.py` - Tests complete flow

## Data Flow
1. **Scraping**: WorkFossa scraper extracts visit number from URL patterns like `/visits/131650/`
2. **Storage**: Visit number is saved to database during work order creation/update
3. **API**: Visit number is included in work order API responses
4. **Frontend**: TypeScript interface includes optional visit_number field

## Usage
The visit_number field will be populated automatically during work order scraping. To populate existing work orders:
1. Clear existing work orders (optional)
2. Run a new work order scrape
3. The visit_number field will be extracted and stored

## Future Considerations
- The visit_number can be used for:
  - Direct navigation to specific visits
  - Tracking visit history
  - Correlating with WorkFossa's internal visit IDs
  - Building visit-specific URLs without full URL storage

## Verification
To verify the implementation:
```bash
# Check database schema
sqlite3 backend/fossawork_v2.db ".schema work_orders" | grep visit_number

# Run test script
python3 backend/scripts/test_visit_number_complete.py
```
