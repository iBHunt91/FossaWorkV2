# Visit URL Extraction Implementation

## Overview
Updated the WorkFossa scraper to capture the visit URL from the "NEXT VISIT" hyperlink in work order listings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Visit Information Extraction (`workfossa_scraper.py`)
- Updated `_extract_visit_info()` method to add detailed logging
- Enhanced visit link detection to handle multiple links in the visits cell
- Improved URL extraction with support for both relative and absolute URLs
- Added extraction of visit ID from the URL pattern `/visits/{visit_id}`
- Enhanced date pattern matching to handle formats like "06/12/2025 (anytime)"

### 2. Updated Work Orders API (`work_orders.py`)
- Modified `get_work_orders()` endpoint to use scraped `visit_url` when available
- Modified `get_work_order()` endpoint to use scraped `visit_url` when available
- Modified `open_work_order_visit()` endpoint to use scraped `visit_url` when available
- Modified `scrape_dispensers()` endpoint to use scraped `visit_url` when available
- URL generation now only happens as a fallback when scraped URL is not available

### 3. Database Schema
- Confirmed `WorkOrder` model already has `visit_url` and `visit_id` fields
- Scraper properly saves both fields during work order scraping

## How It Works

1. **During Scraping**: The scraper looks for links in the Visits cell (typically cell 4) of each work order row
2. **URL Extraction**: When it finds a link with pattern `/app/work/{work_order_id}/visits/{visit_id}`, it:
   - Converts relative URLs to absolute (prepending `https://app.workfossa.com`)
   - Extracts the visit ID from the URL
   - Saves both `visit_url` and `visit_id` to the database

3. **API Usage**: When work orders are requested through the API:
   - If `visit_url` exists in the database, it's used directly
   - If not, the URL generator creates one as a fallback

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Uses the exact URLs from WorkFossa, ensuring correct navigation
2. **Visit ID Tracking**: Captures and stores visit IDs for future reference
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to URL generation for work orders without scraped URLs
4. **Performance**: No need to generate URLs for work orders that have scraped URLs

## Testing

Created test script at `/scripts/test_visit_url_extraction.py` that verifies:
- Visit URL extraction from HTML
- Visit ID extraction from URL
- Date extraction from link text

## Example URLs

- Relative URL in HTML: `/app/work/123456/visits/789012`
- Absolute URL stored: `https://app.workfossa.com/app/work/123456/visits/789012`
- Extracted visit ID: `789012`
