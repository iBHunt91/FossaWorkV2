# Settings Page Endpoints Fix Summary

## Issue
The Settings page in the frontend was failing to load notification preferences and SMTP settings with 500 errors. The browser console showed CORS errors, but these were actually due to the backend crashing before it could set CORS headers.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect instantiation of service classes in the route dependency functions:

1. **UserManagementService** - The constructor takes no arguments, but route files were passing a database session: `UserManagementService(db)`
2. **LoggingService** - Similarly, the constructor takes no arguments, but was being called with: `LoggingService(db)`

## Files Fixed

### Primary Fixes (Settings Page):
1. `/app/routes/settings.py`:
   - Fixed `get_user_service()` to return `UserManagementService()` (no db parameter)
   - Fixed `get_logging_service()` to return `LoggingService()` (no db parameter)

2. `/app/routes/notifications.py`:
   - Fixed `get_user_service()` and `get_logging_service()` functions
   - Updated notification preference endpoints to use async `get_user_preferences()` method
   - Added missing `db` parameter to endpoint functions
   - Removed redundant user lookups (already have `current_user`)

### Additional Fixes (Other Routes):
3. `/app/routes/users.py` - Fixed service instantiation
4. `/app/routes/form_automation.py` - Fixed service instantiation
5. `/app/routes/schedule_detection.py` - Fixed service instantiation
6. `/app/routes/filter_calculation.py` - Fixed inline instantiation

## Technical Details

### Before (Incorrect):
```python
def get_user_service(db: Session = Depends(get_db)) -> UserManagementService:
    return UserManagementService(db)  # ❌ Constructor doesn't accept db parameter
```

### After (Correct):
```python
def get_user_service(db: Session = Depends(get_db)) -> UserManagementService:
    return UserManagementService()  # ✅ Correct - no parameters
```

### Notification Preferences Fix:
```python
# Before
preferences = user_service.get_user_preference(user_id, "notification_preferences")  # ❌ Wrong method name, not async

# After
preferences = await user_service.get_user_preferences(user_id, "notification_preferences", db)  # ✅ Correct
```

## Test Results
All Settings page endpoints now return 200 OK:
- ✅ `/api/notifications/preferences` - Notification preferences
- ✅ `/api/settings/smtp/{user_id}` - SMTP settings
- ✅ `/api/settings/filters/{user_id}` - Work order filters
- ✅ `/api/settings/automation-delays/{user_id}` - Automation delays
- ✅ `/api/settings/provers/{user_id}` - Prover settings
- ✅ `/api/settings/browser/{user_id}` - Browser settings
- ✅ `/api/settings/notification-display/{user_id}` - Notification display
- ✅ `/api/settings/schedule/{user_id}` - Schedule settings

## Remaining Work
While the primary Settings page endpoints are fixed, there are still many other route files that have the same issue with `LoggingService(db)` and `UserManagementService(db)`. These should be fixed as well to prevent similar errors in other parts of the application:

- `advanced_scheduling.py` - Multiple inline `LoggingService(db)` calls
- `filter_cost.py` - Multiple inline `LoggingService(db)` calls
- `filter_inventory.py` - Multiple inline `LoggingService(db)` calls
- `filter_scheduling.py` - Multiple inline `LoggingService(db)` calls
- `scraping_schedules.py` - Multiple inline `LoggingService(db)` calls

## Verification
Use the test script to verify all endpoints are working:
```bash
cd backend
./venv/bin/python scripts/test_settings_page_endpoints.py
```
