# Dispenser Scraping Status Report

## Summary
- **Total Work Orders**: 60 (all have customer URLs)
- **Dispenser Scraping Attempted**: 0
- **Successfully Scraped**: 0
- **Current Status**: Batch scraping initiated but appears to be running slowly or stuck

## Investigation Results

### 1. Customer URL Extraction âœ…
- Fixed the extraction logic to properly get customer URLs from store number hyperlinks
- All 60 work orders now have valid customer URLs
- URLs follow pattern: `https://app.workfossa.com/app/customers/locations/{location_id}/`

### 2. Failed Scraping Analysis
Initially reported 10 failures, but investigation shows:
- **All 60 work orders** are pending dispenser scraping
- No `dispensers_scraped_at` timestamp in any work order
- The batch process was triggered but hasn't completed any work orders yet

### 3. Deleted Locations Issue
- Screenshot evidence shows some locations return "Could not find this location. It may have been deleted."
- This is a legitimate failure reason - some customer locations in WorkFossa are no longer accessible
- Expected behavior: these will fail with appropriate error messages

### 4. Current Batch Scraping
- Triggered via API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/work-orders/scrape-dispensers-batch?user_id={user_id}`
- Process appears to be running (script timed out after 2 minutes)
- No visible progress in database yet

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Progress**: The batch scraping is likely running. Check:
   - Server console logs
   - Progress endpoint: `/api/v1/work-orders/scrape-dispensers/progress/{user_id}`
   - Database for `dispensers_scraped_at` timestamps

2. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - Some locations will succeed and return dispenser data
   - Some locations will fail due to being deleted/inaccessible
   - Success rate will depend on how many locations are still active

3. **Troubleshooting if Stuck**:
   - Check if browser automation is waiting for user input
   - Verify WorkFossa login is successful
   - Check for JavaScript errors on customer location pages
   - Monitor memory usage if processing many pages
