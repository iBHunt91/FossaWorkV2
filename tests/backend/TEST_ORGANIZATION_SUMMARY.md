# Test Organization Summary

## Overview
All test files have been moved from the backend root directory and scripts directory to the proper `/tests/backend/` structure.

## Organization Structure

### `/tests/backend/api/`
- API endpoint tests
- Settings API tests

### `/tests/backend/auth/`
- Authentication flow tests
- Backend auth tests
- Security configuration tests
- WorkFossa login tests
- Auth endpoint tests

### `/tests/backend/dispensers/`
- Dispenser scraping tests
- Single dispenser tests
- Batch dispenser scraping tests
- Dispenser API tests
- Fixed dispenser scraper tests

### `/tests/backend/integration/`
- Complete implementation tests
- All workflows tests
- Interactive fix tests
- Integration structure tests
- Direct persistence tests

### `/tests/backend/models/`
- Model extraction tests
- Address extraction tests
- Address parsing tests
- URL extraction tests

### `/tests/backend/scraping/`
- Batch scraping tests
- Scraper tests (simple, direct, final)
- Page size tests
- Debug extraction tests
- Scraping synchronization tests

### `/tests/backend/services/`
- Advanced scheduling tests
- Filter calculation tests
- Filter cost tests
- Filter inventory tests
- Schedule notification tests

### `/tests/backend/work_orders/`
- Work order scraping tests
- Work order API tests
- Visit URL extraction tests
- Customer URL extraction tests
- Complete work order extraction tests
- Single work order rescrape tests

## Import Fixes
- 5 test files had their imports updated to work from the new location
- All tests now properly reference the backend directory using relative paths

## Files in Root Directory
The following test files remain in the `/tests/backend/` root directory and may need further categorization:
- General test files (test_api.py, test_imports.py, test_setup.py, etc.)
- These are mostly framework/infrastructure tests that don't fit into specific categories

## Next Steps
1. Run pytest from the project root to ensure all tests still work
2. Update any CI/CD configurations to reflect the new test locations
3. Consider creating pytest configuration to discover tests in the new structure
