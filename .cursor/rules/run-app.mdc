# Running the Application

Always run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm run electron:dev:start
```

Do not use other commands like `npm start` or `npm run dev` as they may not properly initialize all required components for development.

This ensures:
1. The Electron environment is properly configured
2. All development tools are correctly loaded
3. The application runs with the correct permissions and settings

If you encounter any issues with this command, check the console output for errors and refer to the project documentation before trying alternative methods.
