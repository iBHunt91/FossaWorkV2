# Core Development Principles Reminder

Before proceeding with any task, ensure you have thoroughly reviewed the following:

1.  **Main Guidelines:** Understand the overall development philosophy and rules outlined in [.cursorrules](mdc:.cursorrules).
2.  **Project Documentation:**
    *   Check task requirements in [tasks/tasks.md](mdc:tasks/tasks.md).
    *   Review system design in [docs/architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md).
    *   Understand technical standards in [docs/technical.md](mdc:docs/technical.md).
    *   Check current progress in [docs/status.md](mdc:docs/status.md).
3.  **Iterate & Focus:** Prioritize iterating on existing code and focus strictly on the assigned task as defined in [.cursorrules](mdc:.cursorrules) and [tasks/tasks.md](mdc:tasks/tasks.md).

Always ask for clarification if documentation is unclear or conflicting.
