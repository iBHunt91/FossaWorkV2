# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design and Implement Batch Processing Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement sequential processing of visits within a batch, using a single browser instance and configurable delay between visits.
# Details:
Iterate over visits in scraped_content.json. Use a single browser instance for all visits. Add a configurable delay (0-5s) between visits. Ensure minimal setup/teardown overhead.

# Test Strategy:
Unit and integration tests for sequential processing, browser instance management, and delay configuration. Manual verification of browser behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Browser Instance Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement logic to create, configure, and dispose of browser instances efficiently
### Details:
Create functions to initialize browser with proper settings, handle browser lifecycle, manage multiple instances if needed, and ensure proper cleanup of resources after processing is complete

## 2. Visit Iteration Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a robust system to iterate through the list of URLs or targets to visit
### Details:
Create a queue-based system to manage URLs, implement pagination handling, and ensure complete processing of all items in the batch with proper tracking of progress

## 3. Delay Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Add configurable delays between operations to prevent rate limiting and simulate human behavior
### Details:
Implement variable delays between requests, add randomization to timing, and create a throttling mechanism to control processing speed based on system load or external constraints

## 4. Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create comprehensive error handling for browser automation failures and network issues
### Details:
Implement retry logic for failed operations, add logging of errors with contextual information, create recovery mechanisms, and handle different types of exceptions that may occur during batch processing

## 5. State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.4
### Description: Develop a system to track and persist the state of batch processing operations
### Details:
Create a state storage mechanism, implement checkpointing to allow resuming interrupted batches, track progress metrics, and maintain audit logs of processing activities

## 6. Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5
### Description: Optimize the batch processing system for speed, resource usage, and reliability
### Details:
Implement parallel processing where appropriate, optimize memory usage, add load balancing for multiple browser instances, and create monitoring for system resource utilization during batch runs

## 7. Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
### Description: Create comprehensive tests to verify the batch processing system works correctly
### Details:
Develop end-to-end tests for the complete batch process, create mock services for testing without external dependencies, implement performance benchmarks, and add validation of output data integrity
