# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Non-Functional Requirements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure performance, reliability, usability, and scalability as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Profile and optimize visit processing to stay within 10-15% of single visit time. Stress test with 40-50 visits. Ensure UI remains responsive and errors do not crash the app.

# Test Strategy:
Performance profiling and load testing. Usability testing with target users.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Performance Profiling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish baseline performance metrics and identify bottlenecks in the system
### Details:
Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization under normal conditions. Create performance benchmarks for critical system functions. Identify performance bottlenecks and prioritize them based on impact.

## 2. Optimization Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop and implement techniques to improve system performance
### Details:
Based on performance profiling results, create optimization plans for identified bottlenecks. Implement code-level optimizations, database query improvements, and caching strategies. Measure performance improvements against baseline metrics.

## 3. Stress Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Evaluate system behavior under extreme conditions and high loads
### Details:
Design stress test scenarios that push the system beyond normal operating conditions. Simulate high user loads, data volumes, and concurrent operations. Document system breaking points and degradation patterns.

## 4. Error Resilience [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
### Details:
Identify potential failure points in the system. Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring. Develop automated recovery procedures for critical system components. Test system recovery from various failure scenarios.

## 5. UI Responsiveness [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Ensure the user interface remains responsive under all conditions
### Details:
Measure and optimize UI rendering times and interaction responsiveness. Implement asynchronous operations for long-running tasks. Add visual feedback for operations that take more than 100ms. Test UI responsiveness across different devices and network conditions.

## 6. Memory Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Optimize memory usage and prevent memory leaks
### Details:
Profile memory consumption patterns across the application. Identify and fix memory leaks. Implement memory optimization techniques such as object pooling and efficient data structures. Establish memory usage thresholds and monitoring.

## 7. Scalability Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.6
### Description: Verify the system can scale to meet future growth requirements
### Details:
Define scalability requirements based on projected growth. Test horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities. Implement load balancing and distribution strategies. Verify database and storage scalability. Document scaling limitations and recommendations.

## 8. Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for all non-functional requirements
### Details:
Document all non-functional requirements, testing methodologies, and results. Create performance tuning guides for developers. Prepare capacity planning documentation. Include monitoring and maintenance procedures. Ensure all documentation follows organizational standards.
